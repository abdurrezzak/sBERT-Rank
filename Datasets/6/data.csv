6,9,Achieving competitive capabilities in e-services What implications does the Internet have for service operations strategy How can business performance of e-service companies be improved in today's knowledge-based economy These research questions are the subject of the paper. We propose a model that links the e-service company's knowledge-based competencies with their competitive capabilities. Drawing from the current literature our analysis suggests that services that strategically build a portfolio of knowledge-based competencies namely human capital structural capital and absorptive capacity have more operations-based options than their counterparts who are less apt to invest. We assume that the combinative capabilities of service quality delivery flexibility and cost are determined by the investment in intellectual capital. Arguably with the advent of the Internet different operating models e.g. bricks-and-mortar clicks-and-mortar or pure dot-com have different strategic imperatives in terms of knowledge-based competencies. Thus the new e-operations paradigm can be viewed as a configuration of knowledge-based competencies and capabilities,"['competitive capabilities', 'e-services', 'Internet', 'service operations strategy', 'business performance', 'knowledge-based economy', 'knowledge-based competencies', 'human capital', 'structural capital', 'absorptive capacity', 'operations-based options', 'combinative capabilities', 'service quality', 'delivery', 'flexibility', 'cost', 'investment', 'intellectual capital', 'bricks-and-mortar', 'clicks-and-mortar', 'dot-com', 'strategic imperatives', 'corporate modelling', 'electronic commerce', 'Internet', 'technological forecasting']",153,26
7,11,Does social capital determine innovation To what extent This paper deals with two questions Does social capital determine innovation in manufacturing firms If it is the case to what extent To deal with these questions we review the literature on innovation in order to see how social capital came to be added to the other forms of capital as an explanatory variable of innovation. In doing so we have been led to follow the dominating view of the literature on social capital and innovation which claims that social capital cannot be captured through a single indicator but that it actually takes many different forms that must be accounted for. Therefore to the traditional explanatory variables of innovation we have added five forms of structural social capital business network assets information network assets research network assets participation assets and relational assets and one form of cognitive social capital reciprocal trust). In a context where empirical investigations regarding the relations between social capital and innovation are still scanty this paper makes contributions to the advancement of knowledge in providing new evidence regarding the impact and the extent of social capital on innovation at the two decisionmaking stages considered in this study,"['innovation', 'manufacturing firms', 'business network assets', 'information network assets', 'research network assets', 'participation assets', 'relational assets', 'cognitive social capital', 'structural social capital', 'reciprocal trust', 'two-stage decision-making process', 'degree of radicalness', 'corporate modelling', 'decision theory', 'manufacturing industries', 'technological forecasting']",199,16
8,12,National learning systems a new approach on technological change in late industrializing economies and evidences from the cases of Brazil and South Korea The paper has two intertwined parts. The first one is a proposal for a conceptual and theoretical framework to understand technical change in late industrializing economies. The second part develops a kind of empirical test of the usefulness of that new framework by means of a comparative study of the Brazilian and South Korean cases. All the four types of macroevidences of the technical change processes of Brazil and Korea corroborate directly or indirectly the hypothesis of the existence of actual cases of national learning systems NLSs of passive and active nature as it is shown to be the cases of Brazil and South Korea respectively. The contrast between the two processes of technical change prove remarkable despite both processes being essentially confined to learning. The concepts of passive and active NLSs show how useful they are to apprehend the diversity of those realities and consequently to avoid for instance interpretations that misleadingly suppose based on conventional economic theory that those countries have a similar lack of technological dynamism,"['national learning systems', 'technological change', 'late industrializing economies', 'Brazil', 'South Korea', 'national innovation system', 'economic cybernetics', 'technological forecasting']",192,8
9,13,Stability analysis of the characteristic polynomials whose coefficients are polynomials of interval parameters using monotonicity We analyze the stability of the characteristic polynomials whose coefficients are polynomials of interval parameters via monotonicity methods. Our stability conditions are based on Frazer-Duncan's theorem and all conditions can be checked using only endpoint values of interval parameters. These stability conditions are necessary and sufficient under the monotonicity assumptions. When the monotonicity conditions do not hold on the whole parameter region we present an interval division method and a transformation algorithm in order to apply the monotonicity conditions. Then our stability analysis methods can be applied to all characteristic polynomials whose coefficients are polynomials of interval parameters,"['stability analysis', 'characteristic polynomials', 'interval parameters', 'monotonicity', 'Frazer-Duncan theorem', 'endpoint values', 'necessary and sufficient conditions', 'interval division method', 'transformation algorithm', 'polynomials', 'stability']",113,11

Based on the concept of VR decomposition the problem of management of such systems is discussed. As a sub-type that makes mMAS closer to the application sphere an evolutionary multi-agent system EMAS is proposed. EMAS combines features of mMAS with advantages of an evolutionary model of computation. As an illustration of this consideration two particular EMAS are presented which allow us to obtain promising results in the fields of multiobjective optimisation and time-series prediction and thus justify the approach,"['mass multiple agent systems', 'VR decomposition', 'virtual reality', 'multiobjective optimisation', 'time-series prediction', 'micro-macro link', 'formal model', 'evolutionary multiple agent system', 'forecasting theory', 'multi-agent systems', 'optimisation', 'time series', 'virtual reality']",134,13
13,17,Fault diagnosis and fault tolerant control of linear stochastic systems with unknown inputs This paper presents an integrated robust fault detection and isolation FDI and fault tolerant control FTC scheme for a fault in actuators or sensors of linear stochastic systems subjected to unknown inputs disturbances). As usual in this kind of works it is assumed that single fault occurs at a time and the fault treated is of random bias type. The FDI module is constructed using banks of robust two-stage Kalman filters which simultaneously estimate the state and the fault bias and generate residual sets decoupled from unknown disturbances. All elements of residual sets are evaluated by using a hypothesis statistical test and the fault is declared according to the prepared decision logic. The FTC module is activated based on the fault indicator and additive compensation signal is computed using the fault bias estimate and combined to the nominal control law for compensating the fault's effect on the system. Simulation results for the simplified longitudinal flight control system with parameter variations process and measurement noises demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach proposed,"['fault detection', 'fault isolation', 'fault tolerant control', 'linear systems', 'stochastic systems', 'two-stage Kalman filters', 'state estimation', 'longitudinal flight control system', 'robust control', 'discrete-time system', 'discrete time systems', 'fault diagnosis', 'fault tolerance', 'Kalman filters', 'linear systems', 'robust control', 'state estimation', 'stochastic systems']",184,18
14,18,Differential and integral calculus on discrete time series data It has been found that discontinuity plays a crucial role in natural evolutions Lin 1998). In this presentation we will generalize the idea of integration and differentiation we developed in calculus to the study of time series in the hope that the problem of outliers and discontinuities can be resolved more successfully than simply deleting the outliers and avoiding discontinuities from the overall data analysis. In general appearances of outliers tend to mean existence of discontinuities explosive growth or decline in the evolution. At the same time our approach can be employed to partially overcome the problem of not having enough data values in any available time series. At the end we will look at some real-life problems of prediction in order to see the power of this new approach,"['natural evolutions', 'integration', 'differentiation', 'time series', 'outliers', 'prediction', 'calculus', 'time series']",139,8

17,21,Discrete output feedback sliding mode control of second order systems  a moving switching line approach The sliding mode control systems SMCS for which the switching variable is designed independent of the initial conditions are known to be sensitive to parameter variations and extraneous disturbances during the reaching phase. For second order systems this drawback is eliminated by using the moving switching line technique where the switching line is initially designed to pass the initial conditions and is subsequently moved towards a predetermined switching line. In this paper we make use of the above idea of moving switching line together with the reaching law approach to design a discrete output feedback sliding mode control. The main contributions of this work are such that we do not require to use system states as it makes use of only the output samples for designing the controller. and by using the moving switching line a low sensitivity system is obtained through shortening the reaching phase. Simulation results show that the fast output sampling feedback guarantees sliding motion similar to that obtained using state feedback,"['sliding mode control', 'switching variable', 'parameter variations', 'moving switching line', 'discrete output feedback', 'fast output sampling feedback', 'state feedback', 'state feedback', 'variable structure systems']",180,9

19,23,Absorption of long waves by nonresonant parametric microstructures Using simple acoustical and mechanical models we consider the conceptual possibility of designing an active absorbing nonreflecting coating in the form of a thin layer with small-scale stratification and fast time modulation of parameters. Algorithms for space-time modulation of the controlled-layer structure are studied in detail for a one-dimensional boundary-value problem. These algorithms do not require wave-field measurements which eliminates the self-excitation problem that is characteristic of active systems. The majority of the considered algorithms of parametric control transform the low-frequency incident wave to high-frequency waves of the technological band for which the waveguiding medium inside the layer is assumed to be opaque absorbing). The efficient use conditions are found for all the algorithms. It is shown that the absorbing layer can be as thin as desired with respect to the minimum spatial scale of the incident wave and ensures efficient absorption in a wide frequency interval starting from zero frequency that is bounded from above only by a finite space-time resolution of the parameter-control operations. The structure of a three-dimensional parametric black coating whose efficiency is independent of the angle of incidence of an incoming wave is developed on the basis of the studied one-dimensional problems. The general solution of the problem of diffraction of incident waves from such a coating is obtained. This solution is analyzed in detail for the case of a disk-shaped element,"['acoustical models', 'mechanical models', 'active absorbing coating', 'nonreflecting coating', 'thin layer', 'small-scale stratification', 'fast time modulation', 'space-time modulation', 'controlled-layer structure', 'one-dimensional boundary-value problem', 'parametric control', 'low-frequency incident wave', 'high-frequency waves', 'waveguiding medium', 'absorbing layer', 'angle of incidence', 'one-dimensional problems', 'diffraction', 'disk-shaped element', 'acoustic parametric devices', 'acoustic wave absorption', 'active noise control', 'antireflection coatings', 'boundary-value problems']",235,24
20,24,Fuzzy modeling based on generalized conjunction operations An approach to fuzzy modeling based on the tuning of parametric conjunction operations is proposed. First some methods for the construction of parametric generalized conjunction operations simpler than the known parametric classes of conjunctions are considered and discussed. Second several examples of function approximation by fuzzy models based on the tuning of the parameters of the new conjunction operations are given and their approximation performances are compared with the approaches based on a tuning of membership functions and other approaches proposed in the literature. It is seen that the tuning of the conjunction operations can be used for obtaining fuzzy models with a sufficiently good performance when the tuning of membership functions is not possible or not desirable,"['fuzzy modeling', 'generalized conjunction operations', 'function approximation', 'tuning', 'approximation performances', 'membership functions', 't-norm', 'fuzzy inference systems', 'function approximation', 'fuzzy logic', 'fuzzy set theory', 'fuzzy systems', 'modelling', 'tuning']",125,14
21,25,Identification of evolving fuzzy rule-based models An approach to identification of evolving fuzzy rule-based eR models is proposed. eR models implement a method for the noniterative update of both the rule-base structure and parameters by incremental unsupervised learning. The rule-base evolves by adding more informative rules than those that previously formed the model. In addition existing rules can be replaced with new rules based on ranking using the informative potential of the data. In this way the rule-base structure is inherited and updated when new informative data become available rather than being completely retrained. The adaptive nature of these evolving rule-based models in combination with the highly transparent and compact form of fuzzy rules makes them a promising candidate for modeling and control of complex processes competitive to neural networks. The approach has been tested on a benchmark problem and on an air-conditioning component modeling application using data from an installation serving a real building. The results illustrate the viability and efficiency of the approach,"['evolving fuzzy rule-based models', 'identification', 'noniterative update', 'rule-base structure', 'incremental unsupervised learning', 'ranking', 'informative potential', 'fuzzy rules', 'complex processes', 'air-conditioning component modeling', 'adaptive nonlinear control', 'fault detection', 'fault diagnostics', 'performance analysis', 'forecasting', 'knowledge extraction', 'robotics', 'behavior modeling', 'fuzzy logic', 'fuzzy set theory', 'identification', 'modelling', 'unsupervised learning']",165,23

23,27,A formal model of computing with words Classical automata are formal models of computing with values. Fuzzy automata are generalizations of classical automata where the knowledge about the system's next state is vague or uncertain. It is worth noting that like classical automata fuzzy automata can only process strings of input symbols. Therefore such fuzzy automata are still abstract devices for computing with values although a certain vagueness or uncertainty are involved in the process of computation. We introduce a new kind of fuzzy automata whose inputs are instead strings of fuzzy subsets of the input alphabet. These new fuzzy automata may serve as formal models of computing with words. We establish an extension principle from computing with values to computing with words. This principle indicates that computing with words can be implemented with computing with values with the price of a big amount of extra computations,"['formal model', 'computing with words', 'fuzzy automata', 'fuzzy subsets', 'input alphabet', 'extension principle', 'pushdown automata', 'finite automata', 'formal languages', 'fuzzy logic']",147,10
24,28,Uncertainty bounds and their use in the design of interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems We derive inner and outer-bound sets for the type-reduced set of an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system FLS based on a new mathematical interpretation of the Karnik-Mendel iterative procedure for computing the type-reduced set. The bound sets can not only provide estimates about the uncertainty contained in the output of an interval type-2 FLS but can also be used to design an interval type-2 FLS. We demonstrate by means of a simulation experiment that the resulting system can operate without type-reduction and can achieve similar performance to one that uses type-reduction. Therefore our new design method based on the bound sets can relieve the computation burden of an interval type-2 FLS during its operation which makes an interval type-2 FLS useful for real-time applications,"['uncertainty bounds', 'interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems', 'inner-bound sets', 'outer-bound sets', 'type-reduced set', 'Karnik-Mendel iterative procedure', 'real-time applications', 'time-series forecasting', 'forecasting theory', 'fuzzy logic', 'fuzzy set theory', 'fuzzy systems', 'iterative methods', 'probability', 'time series', 'uncertain systems']",138,16
25,29,Fuzzy polynomial neural networks hybrid architectures of fuzzy modeling We introduce a concept of fuzzy polynomial neural networks FPNNs a hybrid modeling architecture combining polynomial neural networks PNNs and fuzzy neural networks FNNs). The development of the FPNNs dwells on the technologies of computational intelligence CI namely fuzzy sets neural networks and genetic algorithms. The structure of the FPNN results from a synergistic usage of FNN and PNN. FNNs contribute to the formation of the premise part of the rule-based structure of the FPNN. The consequence part of the FPNN is designed using PNNs. The structure of the PNN is not fixed in advance as it usually takes place in the case of conventional neural networks but becomes organized dynamically to meet the required approximation error. We exploit a group method of data handling GMDH to produce this dynamic topology of the network. The performance of the FPNN is quantified through experimentation that exploits standard data already used in fuzzy modeling. The obtained experimental results reveal that the proposed networks exhibit high accuracy and generalization capabilities in comparison to other similar fuzzy models,"['fuzzy polynomial neural networks', 'hybrid architectures', 'fuzzy modeling', 'highly nonlinear rule-based models', 'computational intelligence', 'fuzzy sets', 'genetic algorithms', 'group method of data handling', 'GMDH', 'dynamic topology', 'fuzzy inference method', 'learning', 'standard backpropagation', 'membership functions', 'learning rates', 'momentum coefficients', 'genetic optimization', 'backpropagation', 'fuzzy logic', 'fuzzy neural nets', 'genetic algorithms', 'identification', 'inference mechanisms', 'modelling']",183,24

We propose some easily implementable solutions for the unclear details of the original paper such as trapezoid approximation of membership functions rule creation from sample data points and selection of important variables. We further suggest an improved parameter identification algorithm to be applied instead of the original one. These details are crucial concerning the method's performance as it is shown in a comparative analysis and helps to improve the accuracy of the built-up model. Finally we propose a possible further rule base reduction which can be applied successfully in certain cases. This improvement reduces the time requirement of the method by up to 16 in our experiments,"['qualitative modeling', 'fuzzy modeling', 'trapezoid approximation', 'membership functions', 'rule creation', 'parameter identification algorithm', 'rule base reduction', 'Sugeno-Yasukawa method', 'function approximation', 'fuzzy logic', 'fuzzy set theory', 'modelling', 'parameter estimation']",125,13
27,31,Adaptive neural/fuzzy control for interpolated nonlinear systems Adaptive control for nonlinear time-varying systems is of both theoretical and practical importance. We propose an adaptive control methodology for a class of nonlinear systems with a time-varying structure. This class of systems is composed of interpolations of nonlinear subsystems which are input-output feedback linearizable. Both indirect and direct adaptive control methods are developed where the spatially localized models in the form of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems or radial basis function neural networks are used as online approximators to learn the unknown dynamics of the system. Without assumptions on rate of change of system dynamics the proposed adaptive control methods guarantee that all internal signals of the system are bounded and the tracking error is asymptotically stable.

28,32,Analysis and efficient implementation of a linguistic fuzzy c-means The paper is concerned with a linguistic fuzzy c-means FCM algorithm with vectors of fuzzy numbers as inputs. This algorithm is based on the extension principle and the decomposition theorem. It turns out that using the extension principle to extend the capability of the standard membership update equation to deal with a linguistic vector has a huge computational complexity. In order to cope with this problem an efficient method based on fuzzy arithmetic and optimization has been developed and analyzed. We also carefully examine and prove that the algorithm behaves in a way similar to the FCM in the degenerate linguistic case. Synthetic data sets and the iris data set have been used to illustrate the behavior of this linguistic version of the FCM,"['linguistic fuzzy c-means algorithm', 'fuzzy numbers', 'extension principle', 'decomposition theorem', 'computational complexity', 'fuzzy arithmetic', 'optimization', 'linguistic vectors', 'computational complexity', 'fuzzy logic', 'fuzzy set theory', 'pattern recognition', 'vectors']",133,13

30,34,Design of PID-type controllers using multiobjective genetic algorithms The design of a PID controller is a multiobjective problem. A plant and a set of specifications to be satisfied are given. The designer has to adjust the parameters of the PID controller such that the feedback interconnection of the plant and the controller satisfies the specifications. These specifications are usually competitive and any acceptable solution requires a tradeoff among them. An approach for adjusting the parameters of a PID controller based on multiobjective optimization and genetic algorithms is presented in this paper.

31,35,Fusion of qualitative bond graph and genetic algorithms A fault diagnosis application In this paper the problem of fault diagnosis via integration of genetic algorithms GA's and qualitative bond graphs QBG's is addressed. We suggest that GA's can be used to search for possible fault components among a system of qualitative equations. The QBG is adopted as the modeling scheme to generate a set of qualitative equations. The qualitative bond graph provides a unified approach for modeling engineering systems in particular mechatronic systems. In order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm we have tested the proposed algorithm on an in-house designed and built floating disc experimental setup. Results from fault diagnosis in the floating disc system are presented and discussed. Additional measurements will be required to localize the fault when more than one fault candidate is inferred. Fault diagnosis is activated by a fault detection mechanism when a discrepancy between measured abnormal behavior and predicted system behavior is observed. The fault detection mechanism is not presented here,"['qualitative bond graph', 'genetic algorithms', 'fault diagnosis', 'fault components', 'qualitative equations', 'engineering systems', 'mechatronic systems', 'floating disc', 'measured abnormal behavior', 'predicted system behavior', 'bond graphs', 'fault diagnosis', 'genetic algorithms', 'search problems']",169,14
32,36,Model predictive control helps to regulate slow processes-robust barrel temperature control Slow temperature control is a challenging control problem. The problem becomes even more challenging when multiple zones are involved such as in barrel temperature control for extruders. Often strict closed-loop performance requirements such as fast startup with no overshoot and maintaining tight temperature control during production are given for such applications. When characteristics of the system are examined it becomes clear that a commonly used proportional plus integral plus derivative PID controller cannot meet such performance specifications for this kind of system. The system either will overshoot or not maintain the temperature within the specified range during the production run. In order to achieve the required performance a control strategy that utilizes techniques such as model predictive control autotuning and multiple parameter PID is formulated. This control strategy proves to be very effective in achieving the desired specifications and is very robust,"['model predictive control', 'slow processes regulation', 'robust barrel temperature control', 'extruders', 'autotuning', 'multiple parameter PID', 'extrusion', 'moulding', 'predictive control', 'robust control', 'temperature control', 'three-term control', 'tuning']",153,13

35,39,Supervisory control design based on hybrid systems and fuzzy events detection. Application to an oxichlorination reactor This paper presents a supervisory control scheme based on hybrid systems theory and fuzzy events detection. The fuzzy event detector is a linguistic model which synthesizes complex relations between process variables and process events incorporating experts knowledge about the process operation. This kind of detection allows the anticipation of appropriate control actions which depend upon the selected membership functions used to characterize the process under scrutiny.

36,40,New tuning method for PID controller In this paper a tuning method for proportional-integral-derivative PID controller and the performance assessment formulas for this method are proposed. This tuning method is based on a genetic algorithm based PID controller design method. For deriving the tuning formula the genetic algorithm based design method is applied to design PID controllers for a variety of processes. The relationship between the controller parameters and the parameters that characterize the process dynamics are determined and the tuning formula is then derived. Using simulation studies the rules for assessing the performance of a PID controller tuned by the proposed method are also given. This makes it possible to incorporate the capability to determine if the PID controller is well tuned or not into an autotuner. An autotuner based on this new tuning method and the corresponding performance assessment rules is also established. Simulations and real-time experimental results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of these formulas,"['tuning method', 'PID controller', 'proportional-integral-derivative controller', 'genetic algorithm', 'controller design method', 'process dynamics', 'autotuner', 'control system analysis', 'control system synthesis', 'genetic algorithms', 'three-term control', 'tuning']",161,12
37,41,Controller performance analysis with LQG benchmark obtained under closed loop conditions This paper proposes a new method for obtaining a linear quadratic Gaussian LQG benchmark in terms of the variances of process input and output from closed-loop data for assessing the controller performance. LQG benchmark has been proposed in the literature to assess controller performance since the LQG tradeoff curve represents the limit of performance in terms of input and output variances. However an explicit parametric model is required to calculate the LQG benchmark. In this work we propose a data driven subspace approach to calculate the LQG benchmark under closed-loop conditions with certain external excitations. The optimal LQG-benchmark variances are obtained directly from the subspace matrices corresponding to the deterministic inputs and the stochastic inputs which are identified using closed-loop data with setpoint excitation. These variances are used for assessing the controller performance. The method proposed in this paper is applicable to both univariate and multivariate systems. Profit analysis for the implementation of feedforward control to the existing feedback-only control system is also analyzed under the optimal LQG performance framework,"['controller performance analysis', 'LQG benchmark', 'linear quadratic Gaussian benchmark', 'closed-loop data', 'subspace matrices', 'deterministic inputs', 'stochastic inputs', 'univariate systems', 'multivariate systems', 'profit analysis', 'feedforward control', 'state space model', 'closed loop systems', 'control system analysis', 'feedforward', 'linear quadratic Gaussian control', 'matrix algebra', 'nonparametric statistics', 'state-space methods']",181,19

41,57,Speaker adaptive modeling by vocal tract normalization This paper presents methods for speaker adaptive modeling using vocal tract normalization VTN along with experimental tests on three databases. We propose a new training method for VTN By using single-density acoustic models per HMM state for selecting the scale factor of the frequency axis we avoid the problem that a mixture-density tends to learn the scale factors of the training speakers and thus cannot be used for selecting the scale factor. We show that using single Gaussian densities for selecting the scale factor in training results in lower error rates than using mixture densities. For the recognition phase we propose an improvement of the well-known two-pass strategy by using a non-normalized acoustic model for the first recognition pass instead of a normalized model lower error rates are obtained. In recognition tests this method is compared with a fast variant of VTN. The two-pass strategy is an efficient method but it is suboptimal because the scale factor and the word sequence are determined sequentially. We found that for telephone digit string recognition this suboptimality reduces the VTN gain in recognition performance by 30 relative. In summary on the German spontaneous speech task Verbmobil the WSJ task and the German telephone digit string corpus SieTill the proposed methods for VTN reduce the error rates significantly,"['speaker adaptive modeling', 'vocal tract normalization', 'databases', 'training method', 'single-density acoustic models', 'HMM state', 'frequency scale factor', 'training speakers', 'single Gaussian densities', 'training results', 'error rate reduction', 'two-pass strategy', 'nonnormalized acoustic model', 'word sequence', 'telephone digit string recognition', 'German spontaneous speech task', 'Verlimobil', 'WSJ task', 'German telephone digit string corpus', 'SieTill', 'acoustic signal processing', 'adaptive signal processing', 'Gaussian processes', 'hidden Markov models', 'speech recognition']",221,25
42,58,Robust speech recognition using probabilistic union models This paper introduces a new statistical approach namely the probabilistic union model for speech recognition involving partial unknown frequency-band corruption. Partial frequency-band corruption accounts for the effect of a family of real-world noises. Previous methods based on the missing feature theory usually require the identity of the noisy bands. This identification can be difficult for unexpected noise with unknown time-varying band characteristics. The new model combines the local frequency-band information based on the union of random events to reduce the dependence of the model on information about the noise. This model partially accomplishes the target offering robustness to partial frequency-band corruption while requiring no information about the noise. This paper introduces the theory and implementation of the union model and is focused on several important advances. These new developments include a new algorithm for automatic order selection a generalization of the modeling principle to accommodate partial feature stream corruption and a combination of the union model with conventional noise reduction techniques to deal with a mixture of stationary noise and unknown nonstationary noise. For the evaluation we used the TIDIGITS database for speaker-independent connected digit recognition. The utterances were corrupted by various types of additive noise stationary or time-varying assuming no knowledge about the noise characteristics. The results indicate that the new model offers significantly improved robustness in comparison to other models,"['robust speech recognition', 'probabilistic union models', 'partial real-world noise', 'automatic order selection', 'modeling', 'partial feature stream corruption', 'noise reduction techniques', 'stationary noise', 'nonstationary noise', 'TIDIGITS database', 'speaker-independent connected digit recognition', 'additive noise', 'noise characteristics', 'missing feature theory', 'noisy bands', 'time-varying band characteristics', 'local frequency-band information', 'partial frequency-band corruption', 'noise', 'probability', 'speech recognition']",229,21
43,59,Efficient tracking of the cross-correlation coefficient In many audio processing algorithms involving manipulation of discrete-time signals the performance can vary strongly over the repertoire that is used. This may be the case when the signals from the various channels are allowed to be strongly positively or negatively correlated. We propose and analyze a general formula for tracking the time-dependent correlation between two signals. Some special cases of this formula lead to classical results known from the literature others are new. This formula is recursive in nature and uses only the instantaneous values of the two signals in a low-cost and low-complexity manner in particular there is no need to take square roots or to carry out divisions. Furthermore this formula can be modified with respect to the occurrence of the two signals so as to further decrease the complexity and increase ease of implementation. The latter modification comes at the expense that not the actual correlation is tracked but rather a somewhat deformed version of it. To overcome this problem we propose for a number of instances of the tracking formula a simple warping operation on the deformed correlation. Now we obtain at least for sinusoidal signals the correct value of the correlation coefficient. Special attention is paid to the convergence behavior of the algorithm for stationary signals and the dynamic behavior if there is a transition to another stationary state the latter is considered to be important to study the tracking abilities to nonstationary signals. We illustrate tracking algorithm by using it for stereo music fragments obtained from a number of digital audio recordings,"['efficient tracking', 'cross-correlation coefficient', 'audio processing algorithms', 'discrete-time signals', 'time-dependent correlation', 'recursive formula', 'warping operation', 'deformed correlation', 'sinusoidal signals', 'convergence behavior', 'stationary signals', 'dynamic behavior', 'stationary state', 'nonstationary signals', 'tracking algorithm', 'stereo music fragments', 'digital audio recording', 'audio signal processing', 'convergence of numerical methods', 'correlation methods', 'music', 'tracking']",265,22
44,60,Perceptual audio coding using adaptive pre and post-filters and lossless compression This paper proposes a versatile perceptual audio coding method that achieves high compression ratios and is capable of low encoding/decoding delay. It accommodates a variety of source signals including both music and speech with different sampling rates. It is based on separating irrelevance and redundancy reductions into independent functional units. This contrasts traditional audio coding where both are integrated within the same subband decomposition. The separation allows for the independent optimization of the irrelevance and redundancy reduction units. For both reductions we rely on adaptive filtering and predictive coding as much as possible to minimize the delay. A psycho-acoustically controlled adaptive linear filter is used for the irrelevance reduction and the redundancy reduction is carried out by a predictive lossless coding scheme which is termed weighted cascaded least mean squared WCLMS method. Experiments are carried out on a database of moderate size which contains mono-signals of different sampling rates and varying nature music speech or mixed). They show that the proposed WCLMS lossless coder outperforms other competing lossless coders in terms of compression ratios and delay as applied to the pre-filtered signal. Moreover a subjective listening test of the combined pre-filter/lossless coder and a state-of-the-art perceptual audio coder PAC shows that the new method achieves a comparable compression ratio and audio quality with a lower delay,"['perceptual audio coding', 'adaptive pre-filters', 'adaptive post-filters', 'lossless compression', 'high compression ratio', 'low encoding/decoding delay', 'source signals', 'music', 'sampling rates', 'redundancy reduction', 'adaptive filtering', 'predictive coding', 'psycho-acoustically controlled adaptive linear filter', 'irrelevance reduction', 'predictive lossless coding', 'weighted cascaded least mean squared', 'WCLMS lossless coder', 'subjective listening test', 'pre-filter/lossless coder', 'audio quality', 'adaptive filters', 'adaptive signal processing', 'audio coding', 'data compression', 'delays', 'filtering theory', 'hearing', 'least squares approximations', 'prediction theory']",227,29

We then propose a new filtering called contextual principal components CPC or time-frequency principal components TFPC). This filtering consists in extracting the principal components of the contextual covariance matrix which is the covariance matrix of a sequence of vectors expanded by their context. We apply this new filtering in the framework of closed-set speaker identification using a subset of the POLYCOST database. When using speaker-dependent TFPC filters our results show a relative improvement of approximately 20 compared to the use of the classical cepstral coefficients augmented by their Delta coefficients which is significantly better with a 90 confidence level,"['time-frequency principal component analysis', 'text-independent speaker identification', 'vector filtering', 'spectral trajectories', 'speech parameterization', 'cepstral analysis', 'Delta Delta parameterization', 'Delta parameterization', 'auto-regressive vector modeling', 'contextual principal components', 'contextual covariance matrix', 'closed-set speaker identification', 'POLYCOST database', 'cepstral coefficients', 'confidence level', 'Delta -coefficients', 'covariance matrices', 'filtering theory', 'principal component analysis', 'speaker recognition', 'time-frequency analysis']",145,21
46,62,Text-independent speaker verification using utterance level scoring and covariance modeling This paper describes a computationally simple method to perform text independent speaker verification using second order statistics. The suggested method called utterance level scoring ULS allows one to obtain a normalized score using a single pass through the frames of the tested utterance. The utterance sample covariance is first calculated and then compared to the speaker covariance using a distortion measure. Subsequently a distortion measure between the utterance covariance and the sample covariance of data taken from different speakers is used to normalize the score. Experimental results from the 2000 NIST speaker recognition evaluation are presented for ULS used with different distortion measures and for a Gaussian mixture model GMM system. The results indicate that ULS as a viable alternative to GMM whenever the computational complexity and verification accuracy needs to be traded,"['text-independent speaker verification', 'utterance level scoring', 'covariance modeling', 'computationally simple method', 'second order statistics', 'normalized score', 'sample covariance', 'speaker covariance', 'distortion measure', 'NIST speaker recognition evaluation', 'distortion measures', 'Gaussian mixture model', 'GMM', 'computational complexity', 'verification accuracy', 'computational complexity', 'covariance analysis', 'Gaussian distribution', 'speaker recognition', 'statistical analysis']",143,20
47,63,Geometric source separation merging convolutive source separation with geometric beamforming Convolutive blind source separation and adaptive beamforming have a similar goal-extracting a source of interest or multiple sources while reducing undesired interferences. A benefit of source separation is that it overcomes the conventional cross-talk or leakage problem of adaptive beamforming. Beamforming on the other hand exploits geometric information which is often readily available but not utilized in blind algorithms. We propose to join these benefits by combining cross-power minimization of second-order source separation with geometric linear constraints used in adaptive beamforming. We find that the geometric constraints resolve some of the ambiguities inherent in the independence criterion such as frequency permutations and degrees of freedom provided by additional sensors. We demonstrate the new method in performance comparisons for actual room recordings of two and three simultaneous acoustic sources,"['geometric source separation', 'geometric beamforming', 'convolutive blind source separation', 'adaptive beamforming', 'cross-talk', 'leakage problem', 'blind algorithms', 'cross-power minimization', 'second-order source separation', 'geometric linear constraints', 'frequency permutations', 'degrees of freedom', 'sensors', 'room recordings', 'acoustic sources', 'acoustic signal processing', 'array signal processing', 'convolution', 'minimisation']",138,19
48,64,Speech enhancement using a mixture-maximum model We present a spectral domain speech enhancement algorithm. The new algorithm is based on a mixture model for the short time spectrum of the clean speech signal and on a maximum assumption in the production of the noisy speech spectrum. In the past this model was used in the context of noise robust speech recognition. In this paper we show that this model is also effective for improving the quality of speech signals corrupted by additive noise. The computational requirements of the algorithm can be significantly reduced essentially without paying performance penalties by incorporating a dual codebook scheme with tied variances. Experiments using recorded speech signals and actual noise sources show that in spite of its low computational requirements the algorithm shows improved performance compared to alternative speech enhancement algorithms,"['mixture-maximum model', 'spectral domain', 'speech enhancement algorithm', 'mixture model', 'short time spectrum', 'clean speech signal', 'noisy speech spectrum', 'noise robust speech recognition', 'speech signal quality', 'additive noise', 'performance penalties', 'dual codebook', 'tied variances', 'recorded speech signals', 'noise sources', 'low computational requirements', 'Gaussian mixture model', 'MIXMAX model', 'speech intelligibility', 'computational complexity', 'Gaussian processes', 'noise', 'spectral analysis', 'speech coding', 'speech enhancement', 'speech intelligibility', 'speech recognition']",136,27

50,66,Regression testing of database applications Database applications features such as Structured Query Language or SQL exception programming integrity constraints and table triggers pose difficulties for maintenance activities especially for regression testing that follows modifications to database applications. In this work we address these difficulties and propose a two phase regression testing methodology. In phase 1 we explore control flow and data flow analysis issues of database applications. Then we propose an impact analysis technique that is based on dependencies that exist among the components of database applications. This analysis leads to selecting test cases from the initial test suite for regression testing the modified application. In phase 2 further reduction in the regression test cases is performed by using reduction algorithms. We present two such algorithms. The Graph Walk algorithm walks through the control flow graph of database modules and selects a safe set of test cases to retest. The Call Graph Firewall algorithm uses a firewall for the inter procedural level. Finally a maintenance environment for database applications is described.

57,73,How does attitude impact IT implementation a study of small business owners According to previous studies attitude towards information technology IT among small business owners appears to be a key factor in achieving high quality IT implementations. In an effort to extend this stream of research we conducted case studies with small business owners and learned that high quality IT implementations resulted with owners who had positive or negative attitudes toward IT but not with owners who had uncertain attitudes. Owners with apolar attitude either positive or negative all took action to temper the uncertainty and risk surrounding the use of new IT in their organization. In contrast owners with uncertain attitudes did not make mitigating attempts to reduce uncertainty and risk. A consistent finding among those with high quality IT implementations was an entrepreneurial or shared management style. It is proposed based on case study data that small business owners with an uncertain attitude towards IT might experience higher quality IT results in their organizations through practicing a more entrepreneurial or shared management style. The study provides insights for both computer specialists and small business owners planning IT implementations,"['small business owners', 'information technology implementation', 'negative attitudes', 'positive attitudes', 'uncertain attitude', 'risk', 'organization', 'management style', 'computer specialists', 'planning', 'business data processing', 'human factors', 'information technology', 'personal computing', 'risk management']",190,15
58,74,End-user perspectives on the uptake of computer supported cooperative working Researchers in information systems have produced a rich collection of meta-analyses and models to further understanding of factors influencing the uptake of information technologies. In the domain of CSCW however these models have largely been neglected and while there are many case studies no systematic account of uptake has been produced. We use findings from information systems research to structure a meta-analysis of uptake issues as reported in CSCW case studies supplemented by a detailed re-examination of one of our own case studies from this perspective. This shows that while there are some factors which seem to be largely specific to CSCW introductions many of the case study results are very similar to standard IS findings.

59,75,A portable Auto Attendant System with sophisticated dialog structure An attendant system connects the caller to the party he/she wants to talk to. Traditional systems require the caller to know the full name of the party. If the caller forgets the name the system fails to provide service for the caller. In this paper we propose a portable Auto Attendant System AAS with sophisticated dialog structure that gives a caller more flexibility while calling. The caller may interact with the system to request a phone number by providing just a work area specialty surname or title etc. If the party is absent the system may provide extra information such as where he went when he will be back and what he is doing. The system is built modularly with components such as speech recognizer language model dialog manager and text-to-speech that can be replaced if necessary. By simply changing the personnel record database the system can easily be ported to other companies. The sophisticated dialog manager applies many strategies to allow natural interaction between user and system. Functions such as fuzzy request user repairing and extra information query which are not provided by other systems are integrated into our system.

60,76,Reaching strong consensus in a general network The strong consensus SC problem is a variant of the conventional distributed consensus problem also known as the Byzantine agreement problem). The SC problem requires that the agreed value among fault-free processors be one of the fault-free processor's initial values. Originally the problem was studied in a fully connected network with malicious faulty processors. In this paper the SC problem is re-examined in a general network in which the components processors and communication links may be subjected to different faulty types simultaneously also called the hybrid fault model or mixed faulty types and the network topology does not have to be fully connected.

61,77,Modeling frequently accessed wireless data with weak consistency To reduce the response times of wireless data access in a mobile network caches are utilized in wireless handheld devices. If the original data entry has been updated the cached data in the handheld device becomes stale. Thus a mechanism is required to predict when the cached copy will expire. This paper studies a weakly consistent data access mechanism that computes the time-to-live TTL interval to predict the expiration time. We propose an analytic model to investigate this TTL-based algorithm for frequently accessed data. The analytic model is validated against simulation experiments.

62,78,Applying genetic algorithms to solve the fuzzy optimal profit problem This study investigated the application of genetic algorithms in solving a fuzzy optimization problem that arises in business and economics. In this problem a fuzzy price is determined using a linear or a quadratic fuzzy demand function as well as a linear cost function. The objective is to find the optimal fuzzy profit which is derived from the fuzzy price and fuzzy cost. Traditional methods for solving this problem are 1 the extension principle and 2 using interval arithmetic and alpha cuts. However we argue that traditional methods for solving this problem are too restrictive to produce an optimal solution and that an alternative approach is possibly needed. We use genetic algorithms to obtain an approximate solution for this fuzzy optimal profit problem without using membership functions. We not only give empirical examples to show the effectiveness of this approach but also give theoretical proofs to validate correctness of the algorithm. We conclude that genetic algorithms can produce good approximate solutions when applied to solve fuzzy optimization problems,"['genetic algorithms', 'fuzzy optimization problem', 'fuzzy optimal profit problem', 'economics', 'business', 'fuzzy price', 'quadratic fuzzy demand function', 'linear fuzzy demand function', 'linear cost function', 'approximate solution', 'theoretical proofs', 'algorithm correctness validation', 'economic cybernetics', 'fuzzy logic', 'fuzzy set theory', 'genetic algorithms', 'program verification']",178,17

For two given strings of length m and n where m>or=n the algorithm can solve the LCS problem in m+2r-1 respectively n+2r-1 time steps with r<n/2 respectively r<m/2 processors. Experimental results show that the algorithm can be faster on multicomputers than all the previous systolic algorithms for the same problem,"['systolic algorithm', 'longest common subsequence problem', 'scalable algorithm', 'parallel algorithms', 'data structures', 'parallel algorithms', 'systolic arrays']",128,7

67,83,A distributed mobile agent framework for maintaining persistent distance education Mobile agent techniques involve distributed control if communication is required among different types of agents especially when mobile agents can migrate from station to station. This technique can be implemented in a distributed distance learning environment which allows students or instructors to login from anywhere to a central server in an education center while still retaining the look-and-feel of personal setups. In this research paper we propose a distributed agent framework along with its communication messages to facilitate mobile personal agents which serve three different groups of distance education users instructors students and system administrators. We propose an agent communication framework as well as agent evolution states of mobile agents. The communication architecture and message transmission protocols are illustrated. The system is implemented on the Windows platform to support nomadic accessibility of remote distance learning users. Personal data also migrate with the mobile agents allowing users to maintain accessibility to some extent even when the Internet connection is temperately disconnected. Using user-friendly personal agents a distance education platform can include different tools to meet different needs for users,"['distributed mobile agent framework', 'persistent distance education', 'distributed control', 'central server', 'distributed agent framework', 'message transmission protocols', 'user-friendly personal agents', 'computer aided instruction', 'distance learning', 'Internet', 'software agents']",188,11

70,86,Laser-based internal profile measurement system An automatic laser-based system to measure the internal profiles of various structures has been developed. The system uses a point laser source through a rotating optical device fixed on to a laser measurement meter. A notebook computer with custom software is used to control the laser meter and rotating device to estimate the scanned profile shape and to determine the resulting cross-section area. The information provided by this system is essential to construction industry including window and door builders the glass panel board and floor tile manufacturers carpet venders and building contractors for cost estimation and production control. As a result the lead time for delivering the customized windowpanes woodwork floor tiles and ceilings can be reduced. Applications of this system for measuring the shapes of window frames and floor plans are described and demonstrated. The measurement accuracy is evaluated and analyzed.

74,90,LAN-based building maintenance and surveillance robot The building and construction industry is the major industry of Hong Kong as in many developed countries around the world. After the commissioning of a high-rise building or a large estate substantial manpower both inside the management centre under a standby manner as well as surveillance for security purposes around the whole building is required for daily operation to ensure a quality environment for the occupants. If the surveillance job can be done by robots the efficiency can be highly enhanced resulting in a great saving of manpower and the improved safety of the management staff as a by-product. Furthermore if the robot can retrieve commands from the building management system via a local area network LAN further savings in manpower can be achieved in terms of first-line fault attendance by human management staff. This paper describes the development of a robot prototype here in Hong Kong which can handle some daily routine maintenance works and surveillance responsibilities. The hardware structure of the robot and its on-board devices are described. Real-time images captured by a camera on the robot with pan/tilt/zoom functions can be transmitted back to the central management office via a local area network. The interface between the robot and the building automation system BAS of the building is discussed. This is the first key achievement of this project with a strong implication on reducing the number of human staff to manage a modem building. Teleoperation of the robot via the Internet or intranet is also possible which is the second achievement of this project. Finally the robot can identify its physical position inside the building by a landmark recognition method based on standard CAD drawings which is the third achievement of this project. The main goal of this paper is not the description of some groundbreaking technology in robotic development. It is mainly intended to convince building designers and managers to incorporate robotic systems when they are managing modem buildings to save manpower and improve efficiency,"['LAN-based building maintenance and surveillance robot', 'high-rise building', 'security purposes', 'building management system', 'local area network', 'first-line fault attendance', 'hardware structure', 'pan/tilt/zoom functions', 'teleoperation', 'landmark recognition method', 'building management systems', 'local area networks', 'mobile robots', 'security', 'surveillance']",335,15

92,111,Modification for synchronization of Rossler and Chen chaotic systems Active control is an effective method for making two identical Rossler and Chen systems be synchronized. However this method works only for a certain class of chaotic systems with known parameters both in drive systems and response systems. Modification based on Lyapunov stability theory is proposed in order to overcome this limitation. An adaptive synchronization controller which can make the states of two identical Rossler and Chen systems globally asymptotically synchronized in the presence of system's unknown constant parameters is derived. Especially when some unknown parameters are positive we can make the controller more simple besides the controller is independent of those positive uncertain parameters. At last when the condition that arbitrary unknown parameters in two systems are identical constants is cancelled we demonstrate that it is possible to synchronize two chaotic systems. All results are proved using a well-known Lyapunov stability theorem. Numerical simulations are given to validate the proposed synchronization approach,"['synchronization', 'Rossler chaotic systems', 'Chen chaotic systems', 'active control', 'response systems', 'Lyapunov stability theory', 'adaptive synchronization controller', 'global asymptotic synchronization', 'asymptotic stability', 'chaos', 'Lyapunov matrix equations', 'nonlinear control systems', 'nonlinear dynamical systems', 'synchronisation']",162,14

In the first of these series we consider special states | phi  invariant under charge conjugation that generalizes the N = 2 spin S = 1/2 Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state and in the second one we consider generalizations of the Werner 1989 density matrices. The evaluation of the critical point x/sub c was done through bounds coming from the partial transposition method of Peres 1996 and the conditional nonextensive entropy criterion.

A third goal is to provide several alternate viewpoints for this body of work as the methods and concepts we describe intersect with a number of other fields. The principle focus of our presentation is the class of MR Markov processes defined on pyramidally organized trees.

99,118,Sensorless control of induction motor drives Controlled induction motor drives without mechanical speed sensors at the motor shaft have the attractions of low cost and high reliability. To replace the sensor the information on the rotor speed is extracted from measured stator voltages and currents at the motor terminals. Vector-controlled drives require estimating the magnitude and spatial orientation of the fundamental magnetic flux waves in the stator or in the rotor. Open-loop estimators or closed-loop observers are used for this purpose. They differ with respect to accuracy robustness and sensitivity against model parameter variations. Dynamic performance and steady-state speed accuracy in the low-speed range can be achieved by exploiting parasitic effects of the machine.

101,120,Self-organized critical traffic in parallel computer networks In a recent paper we analysed the dynamics of traffic flow in a simple square lattice architecture. It was shown that a phase transition takes place between a free and a congested phase. The transition point was shown to exhibit optimal information transfer and wide fluctuations in time with scale-free properties. In this paper we further extend our analysis by considering a generalization of the previous model in which the rate of packet emission is regulated by the local congestion perceived by each node. As a result of the feedback between traffic congestion and packet release the system is poised at criticality.

103,122,A formal framework for viewpoint consistency Multiple viewpoint models of system development are becoming increasingly important. Each viewpoint offers a different perspective on the target system and system development involves parallel refinement of the multiple views. Viewpoint related approaches have been considered in a number of different guises by a spectrum of researchers. Our work particularly focuses on the use of viewpoints in open distributed processing ODP which is an ISO/ITU standardisation framework. The requirements of viewpoint modelling in ODP are very broad and hence demanding. Multiple viewpoints though prompt the issue of consistency between viewpoints. This paper describes a very general interpretation of consistency which we argue is broad enough to meet the requirements of consistency in ODP. We present a formal framework for this general interpretation highlight basic properties of the interpretation and locate restricted classes of consistency. Strategies for checking consistency are also investigated. Throughout we illustrate our theory using the formal description technique LOTOS. Thus the paper also characterises the nature of and options for consistency checking in LOTOS,"['multiple viewpoint models', 'formal framework', 'viewpoint consistency', 'system development', 'open distributed processing', 'ODP', 'ISO/ITU standardisation framework', 'consistency checking', 'formal description technique', 'LOTOS', 'development models', 'process algebra', 'distributed processing', 'formal specification', 'formal verification', 'ISO standards', 'process algebra', 'specification languages']",173,18

It has less back-bias effect compared to other logic styles which use stacked transistors. Furthermore PDL needs no signal ordering or tapering. PDL with speed-enhanced skewed static logic renders straightforward logic synthesis without the usual area penalty due to logic duplication.

107,126,A new architecture for implementing pipelined FIR ADF based on classification of coefficients In this paper we propose a new method for implementing pipelined finite-impulse response FIR adaptive digital filter ADF with an aim of reducing the maximum delay of the filtering portion of conventional delayed least mean square DLMS pipelined ADF. We achieve a filtering section with a maximum delay of one by simplifying a pre-upsampled and a post-downsampled FIR filter using the concept of classification of coefficients. This reduction is independent of the order of the filter which is an advantage when the order of the filter is very large and as a result the method can also be applied to infinite impulse response IIR filters. Furthermore when the proposed method is compared with the transpose ADF which has a filtering section with zero delay it is realized that it significantly reduces the maximum delay associated with updating the coefficients of FIR ADF. The effect of this is that the proposed method exhibits a higher convergence speed in comparison to the transpose FIR ADF,"['pipelined FIR ADF', 'coefficient classification', 'adaptive digital filter', 'maximum delay', 'delayed least mean square filter', 'pre-upsampled filter', 'post-downsampled filter', 'convergence speed', 'adaptive filters', 'delays', 'digital filters', 'FIR filters', 'least mean squares methods', 'pipeline processing']",176,14
108,127,Asymptotical stability in discrete-time neural networks In this work we present a proof of the existence of a fixed point and a generalized sufficient condition that guarantees the stability of it in discrete-time neural networks by using the Lyapunov function method. We also show that for both symmetric and asymmetric connections the unique attractor is a fixed point when several conditions are satisfied. This is an extended result of Chen and Aihara see Physica D vol. 104 no. 3/4 p. 286-325 1997). In particular we further study the stability of equilibrium in discrete-time neural networks with the connection weight matrix in form of an interval matrix.

While systematic errors can be minimized by proper circuit techniques random sources are unavoidable. In this paper a statistical analysis of the resolution of a typical converter is carried out taking into account process tolerances.

It is shown that a tree structured filter bank is biorthogonal if it is equivalent to a tree structured filter bank whose matching constituent levels on the analysis and synthesis sides are themselves biorthogonal pairs. We then show that a stronger statement can be made about dyadic filter banks in general That a dyadic filter bank is biorthogonal if both the analysis and synthesis banks can be decomposed into dyadic trees. We further show that these decompositions are stability and FIR preserving. These results derived for filter banks having filters with rational transfer functions thus extend some of the earlier comparable results for orthonormal filter banks,"['biorthogonal nonuniform filter banks', 'tree structured filter bank', 'biorthogonal pairs', 'dyadic filter banks', 'dyadic trees', 'stability preserving', 'FIR preserving', 'rational transfer functions', 'filtering theory', 'FIR filters', 'linear phase filters', 'matrix algebra', 'stability', 'wavelet transforms']",121,14
113,132,A unified view for vector rotational CORDIC algorithms and architectures based on angle quantization approach Vector rotation is the key operation employed extensively in many digital signal processing applications. In this paper we introduce a new design concept called Angle Quantization AQ). It can be used as a design index for vector rotational operation where the rotational angle is known in advance. Based on the AQ process we establish a unified design framework for cost-effective low-latency rotational algorithms and architectures. Several existing works such as conventional COordinate Rotational Digital Computer CORDIC AR-CORDIC MVR-CORDIC and EEAS-based CORDIC can be fitted into the design framework forming a Vector Rotational CORDIC Family. Moreover we address four searching algorithms to solve the optimization problem encountered in the proposed vector rotational CORDIC family. The corresponding scaling operations of the CORDIC family are also discussed.

114,133,L/sub p stability and linearization A theorem by Hadamard gives a two-part condition under which a map from one Banach space to another is a homeomorphism. The theorem while often very useful is incomplete in the sense that it does not explicitly specify the family of maps for which the condition is met. Recently under a typically weak additional assumption on the map it was shown that Hadamard's condition is met if and only if the map is a homeomorphism with a Lipschitz continuous inverse. Here an application is given concerning the relation between the L/sub p stability with 1 or= p  infinity  of a nonlinear system and the stability of related linear systems. We also give a result that directs attention to a fundamental limitation concerning what can be proved about linearization and stability for a related familiar family of feedback systems,"['Banach space', ""Hadamard's condition"", 'Lipschitz continuous inverse', 'L/sub p/ stability', 'nonlinear system', 'linear systems', 'feedback systems', 'feedback', 'input-output stability', 'linearisation techniques', 'nonlinear systems']",143,11
115,134,A model of periodic oscillation for genetic regulatory systems In this paper we focus on modeling and explaining periodic oscillations in gene-protein systems with a simple nonlinear model and on analyzing effects of time delay on the stability of oscillations. Our main model of genetic regulation comprises of a two-gene system with an autoregulatory feedback loop. We exploit multiple time scales and hysteretic properties of the model to construct periodic oscillations with jumping dynamics and analyze the possible mechanism according to the singular perturbation theory. As shown in this paper periodic oscillations are mainly generated by nonlinearly negative and positive feedback loops in gene regulatory systems whereas the jumping dynamics is generally caused by time scale differences among biochemical reactions. This simple model may actually act as a genetic oscillator or switch in gene-protein networks because the dynamics are robust for parameter perturbations or environment variations. We also explore effects of time delay on the stability of the dynamics showing that the time delay generally increases the stability region of the oscillations thereby making the oscillations robust to parameter changes.

117,136,Design of 1-D and 2-D variable fractional delay allpass filters using weighted least-squares method In this paper a weighted least-squares method is presented to design one-dimensional and two-dimensional variable fractional delay allpass filters. First each coefficient of the variable allpass filter is expressed as the polynomial of the fractional delay parameter. Then the nonlinear phase error is approximated by a weighted equation error such that the cost function can be converted into a quadratic form. Next by minimizing the weighted equation error the optimal polynomial coefficients can be obtained iteratively by solving a set of linear simultaneous equations at each iteration. Finally the design examples are demonstrated to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,"['weighted least-squares method', 'variable fractional delay allpass filters', '1D allpass filters', '2D allpass filters', 'fractional delay parameter', 'nonlinear phase error approximation', 'weighted equation error', 'cost function', 'optimal polynomial coefficients', 'linear simultaneous equations', 'all-pass filters', 'delays', 'filtering theory', 'iterative methods', 'least squares approximations', 'polynomials']",115,16
118,137,An efficient DIPIE algorithm for CAD of electrostatically actuated MEMS devices Pull-in parameters are important properties of electrostatic actuators. Efficient and accurate analysis tools that can capture these parameters for different design geometries are therefore essential. Current simulation tools approach the pull-in state by iteratively adjusting the voltage applied across the actuator electrodes. The convergence rate of this scheme gradually deteriorates as the pull-in state is approached. Moreover the convergence is inconsistent and requires many mesh and accuracy refinements to assure reliable predictions. As a result the design procedure of electrostatically actuated MEMS devices can be time-consuming. In this paper a novel Displacement Iteration Pull-In Extraction DIPIE scheme is presented. The DIPIE scheme is shown to converge consistently and far more rapidly than the Voltage Iterations VI scheme 100 times faster!). The DIPIE scheme requires separate mechanical and electrostatic field solvers. Therefore it can be easily implemented in existing MOEMS CAD packages.

119,138,Optical actuation of a bistable MEMS This paper presents an optical actuation scheme for MEMS devices based on the well-established fact that light possesses momentum and hence imparts a force equal to 2 W/c when reflected by a surface. Here W is the total power of the reflected light and c is the speed of light. Radiation pressure as it is known is nearly insignificant for most macroscale applications but it can be quite significant for MEMS devices. In addition light actuation offers a new paradigm. First intersecting light beams do not interfere in contrast to electrical conductors which short when they come into contact. Second light can operate in high temperature and high radiation environments far outside the capability of solid state electronic components. This actuation method is demonstrated both in air and in vacuum by switching the state of a bistable MEMS device.

120,139,Equilibrium swelling and kinetics of pH-responsive hydrogels models experiments and simulations The widespread application of ionic hydrogels in a number of applications like control of microfluidic flow development of muscle-like actuators filtration/separation and drug delivery makes it important to properly understand these materials. Understanding hydrogel properties is also important from the standpoint of their similarity to many biological tissues. Typically gel size is sensitive to outer solution pH and salt concentration. In this paper we develop models to predict the swelling/deswelling of hydrogels in buffered pH solutions. An equilibrium model has been developed to predict the degree of swelling of the hydrogel at a given pH and salt concentration in the solution. A kinetic model has been developed to predict the rate of swelling of the hydrogel when the solution pH is changed. Experiments are performed to characterize the mechanical properties of the hydrogel in different pH solutions. The degree of swelling as well as the rate of swelling of the hydrogel are also studied through experiments.

I see ibid. vol. 11 no. 5 p. 427-36 2002). Describes the fabrication implementation and characterization of a thermal driven microinjector featuring a bubble check valve and monolithic fabrication. Microfabrication of this microinjector is based on bulk/surface-combined micromachining of the silicon wafer free of the bonding process that is commonly used in the fabrication of commercial printing head so that even solvents and fuels can be ejected. Droplet ejection sequences of two microinjectors have been studied along with a commercial inkjet printhead for comparison. The droplet ejection of our microinjector with 10 mu m diameter nozzle has been characterized at a frequency over 35 kHz at least 3 times higher than those of commercial counterparts. The droplet volume from this device is smaller than 1 pl 10 times smaller than those of commercial inkjets employed in the consumer market at the time of testing.

122,141,A high-resolution high-frequency monolithic top-shooting microinjector free of satellite drops  part I concept design and model Introduces an innovative microinjector design featuring a bubble valve which entails superior droplet ejection characteristics and monolithic fabrication which allows handling of a wide range of liquids. This new microinjector uses asymmetric bubbles to reduce crosstalk increase frequency response and eliminate satellite droplets. During a firing i.e. droplet ejection the virtual valve closes by growing a thermal bubble in the microchannel to isolate the microchamber from the liquid supply and neighboring chambers. Between firings however the virtual valve opens by collapsing the bubble to reduce flow restriction for fast refilling of the microchamber. The use of bubble valves brings about fast and reliable device operation without imposing the significant complication fabrication of physical microvalves would call for. In addition through a special heater configuration and chamber designs bubbles surrounding the nozzle cut off the tail of the droplets being ejected and completely eliminate satellite droplets. A simple one-dimensional model of the operation of the microinjector is used to estimate the bubble formation and liquid refilling,"['monolithic top-shooting microinjector', 'bubble valve', 'droplet ejection characteristics', 'asymmetric bubbles', 'crosstalk', 'liquid refilling', 'frequency response', 'satellite droplets', 'virtual valve', 'inkjet printing', 'thermal bubble jet', 'flow restriction', 'chamber designs', 'crosstalk', 'drops', 'frequency response', 'ink jet printers', 'microfluidics']",181,18

136,155,Fuzzy non-homogeneous Markov systems In this paper the theory of fuzzy logic and fuzzy reasoning is combined with the theory of Markov systems and the concept of a fuzzy non-homogeneous Markov system is introduced for the first time. This is an effort to deal with the uncertainty introduced in the estimation of the transition probabilities and the input probabilities in Markov systems. The asymptotic behaviour of the fuzzy Markov system and its asymptotic variability is considered and given in closed analytic form. Moreover the asymptotically attainable structures of the system are estimated also in a closed analytic form under some realistic assumptions. The importance of this result lies in the fact that in most cases the traditional methods for estimating the probabilities can not be used due to lack of data and measurement errors. The introduction of fuzzy logic into Markov systems represents a powerful tool for taking advantage of the symbolic knowledge that the experts of the systems possess,"['fuzzy nonhomogeneous Markov systems', 'fuzzy logic', 'fuzzy reasoning', 'uncertainty', 'transition probabilities', 'input probabilities', 'asymptotic variability', 'measurement errors', 'symbolic knowledge', 'probability theory', 'fuzzy logic', 'fuzzy systems', 'inference mechanisms', 'Markov processes', 'probability', 'uncertainty handling']",160,16

Eigenfeatures are derived from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the binary edge data set constructed from eye and mouth fields. Such eigenfeatures are ideal features for finely locating fields efficiently. The eigenfeatures are extracted from a set of the positive and negative training samples for facial features and are used to train a multilayer perceptron MLP whose output indicates the degree to which a particular image window contains the eyes or the mouth within itself. An ensemble network consisting of a multitude of independent MLPs was used to enhance the generalization performance of a single MLP.

139,158,Neural and neuro-fuzzy integration in a knowledge-based system for air quality prediction We propose a unified approach for integrating implicit and explicit knowledge in neurosymbolic systems as a combination of neural and neuro-fuzzy modules. In the developed hybrid system a training data set is used for building neuro-fuzzy modules and represents implicit domain knowledge. The explicit domain knowledge on the other hand is represented by fuzzy rules which are directly mapped into equivalent neural structures. The aim of this approach is to improve the abilities of modular neural structures which are based on incomplete learning data sets since the knowledge acquired from human experts is taken into account for adapting the general neural architecture. Three methods to combine the explicit and implicit knowledge modules are proposed. The techniques used to extract fuzzy rules from neural implicit knowledge modules are described. These techniques improve the structure and the behavior of the entire system. The proposed methodology has been applied in the field of air quality prediction with very encouraging results.

140,159,An intelligent system combining different resource-bounded reasoning techniques In this paper PRIMES Progressive Reasoning and Intelligent multiple MEthods System a new architecture for resource-bounded reasoning that combines a form of progressive reasoning and the so-called multiple methods approach is presented. Each time-critical reasoning unit is designed in such a way that it delivers an approximate result in time whenever an overload or a failure prevents the system from producing the most accurate result. Indeed reasoning units use approximate processing based on two salient features. First an incremental processing unit constructs an approximate solution quickly and then refines it incrementally. Second a multiple methods approach proposes different alternatives to solve the problem each of them being selected according to the available resources. In allowing several resource-bounded reasoning paradigms to be combined we hope to extend their actual scope to cover more real-world application domains,"['resource-bounded reasoning techniques', 'intelligent multiple methods system', 'time-critical reasoning unit', 'approximate processing', 'complex systems', 'real-time performance', 'PRIMES', 'progressive reasoning', 'inference mechanisms', 'knowledge based systems', 'real-time systems']",143,11

We sample four groups of people business school academics professors deans of business schools executive MBA students/recent graduates and senior business executives.

The study examines how such companies can increase their clients perception of engagement success through increased client trust that is brought about through responsive and dependable customization. Survey data from ERP customization clients show that as hypothesized clients trust influenced their perception of engagement success with the company. The data also show that clients trust in the customization company was increased when the company behaved in accordance with client expectations by being responsive and decreased when the company behaved in a manner that contradicted these expectations by not being dependable. Responses to an open-ended question addendum attached to the survey corroborated the importance of responsiveness and dependability.

150,169,MRP in a job shop environment using a resource constrained project scheduling model One of the most difficult tasks in a job shop manufacturing environment is to balance schedule and capacity in an ongoing basis. MRP systems are commonly used for scheduling although their inability to deal with capacity constraints adequately is a severe drawback. In this study we show that material requirements planning can be done more effectively in a job shop environment using a resource constrained project scheduling model. The proposed model augments MRP models by incorporating capacity constraints and using variable lead time lengths. The efficacy of this approach is tested on MRP systems by comparing the inventory carrying costs and resource allocation of the solutions obtained by the proposed model to those obtained by using a traditional MRP model. In general it is concluded that the proposed model provides improved schedules with considerable reductions in inventory carrying costs,"['job shop environment', 'MRP', 'resource constrained project scheduling model', 'material requirements planning', 'scheduling', 'capacity constraints', 'variable lead time lengths', 'inventory carrying costs', 'resource allocation', 'project management', 'manufacturing resources planning', 'production control', 'project management', 'resource allocation', 'stock control']",152,15
151,170,The impact of the product mix on the value of flexibility Product-mix flexibility is one of the major types of manufacturing flexibility referring to the ability to produce a broad range of products or variants with presumed low changeover costs. The value of such a capability is important to establish for an industrial firm in order to ensure that the flexibility provided will be at the right level and used profitably rather than in excess of market requirements and consequently costly. We use option-pricing theory to analyse the impact of various product-mix issues on the value of flexibility. The real options model we use incorporates multiple products capacity constraints as well as set-up costs. The issues treated here include the number of products demand variability correlation between products and the relative demand distribution within the product mix. Thus we are interested in the nature of the input data to analyse its effect on the value of flexibility. We also check the impact at different capacity levels. The results suggest that the value of flexibility i increases with an increasing number of products ii decreases with increasing volatility of product demand iii decreases the more positively correlated the demand is and iv reduces for marginal capacity with increasing levels of capacity. Of these the impact of positively correlated demand seems to be a major issue. However the joint impact of the number of products and demand correlation showed some non-intuitive results,"['product-mix flexibility', 'flexible manufacturing', 'manufacturing flexibility', 'low changeover costs', 'industrial firm', 'option-pricing theory', 'real options model', 'multiple products', 'capacity constraints', 'set-up costs', 'demand variability', 'product correlation', 'relative demand distribution', 'product demand volatility', 'marginal capacity', 'positively correlated demand', 'demand correlation', 'capital budgeting', 'budgeting', 'flexible manufacturing systems', 'management science']",240,21

157,176,Knowledge model reuse therapy decision through specialisation of a generic decision model We present the definition of the therapy decision task and its associated Heuristic Multi-Attribute HM solving method in the form of a KADS-style specification. The goal of the therapy decision task is to identify the ideal therapy for a given patient in accordance with a set of objectives of a diverse nature constituting a global therapy-evaluation framework in which considerations such as patient preferences and quality-of-life results are integrated. We give a high-level overview of this task as a specialisation of the generic decision task and additional decomposition methods for the subtasks involved. These subtasks possess some reflective capabilities for reasoning about self-models particularly the learning subtask which incrementally corrects and refines the model used to assess the effects of the therapies. This work illustrates the process of reuse in the framework of AI software development methodologies such as KADS-CommonKADS in order to obtain new more specialised but still generic components for the analysis libraries developed in this context. In order to maximise reuse benefits where possible the therapy decision task and HM method have been defined in terms of regular components from the earlier-mentioned libraries. To emphasise the importance of using a rigorous approach to the modelling of domain and method ontologies we make extensive use of the semi-formal object-oriented analysis notation UML together with its associated constraint language OCL to illustrate the ontology of the decision method and the corresponding specific one of the therapy decision domain the latter being a refinement via inheritance of the former,"['knowledge model reuse', 'therapy decision task', 'KADS-style specification', 'global therapy-evaluation framework', 'patient preferences', 'reasoning', 'learning subtask', 'software development methodologies', 'CommonKADS', 'ontologies', 'object-oriented analysis notation', 'UML', 'constraint language', 'OCL', 'generic decision model specialisation', 'Heuristic Multi-Attribute solving method', 'decision support systems', 'heuristic programming', 'knowledge acquisition', 'medical expert systems', 'object-oriented methods', 'patient treatment', 'specification languages']",261,23
158,177,Turning telecommunications call details to churn prediction a data mining approach As deregulation new technologies and new competitors open up the mobile telecommunications industry churn prediction and management has become of great concern to mobile service providers. A mobile service provider wishing to retain its subscribers needs to be able to predict which of them may be at-risk of changing services and will make those subscribers the focus of customer retention efforts. In response to the limitations of existing churn-prediction systems and the unavailability of customer demographics in the mobile telecommunications provider investigated we propose design and experimentally evaluate a churn-prediction technique that predicts churning from subscriber contractual information and call pattern changes extracted from call details. This proposed technique is capable of identifying potential churners at the contract level for a specific prediction time-period. In addition the proposed technique incorporates the multi-classifier class-combiner approach to address the challenge of a highly skewed class distribution between churners and non-churners. The empirical evaluation results suggest that the proposed call-behavior-based churn-prediction technique exhibits satisfactory predictive effectiveness when more recent call details are employed for the churn prediction model construction. Furthermore the proposed technique is able to demonstrate satisfactory or reasonable predictive power within the one-month interval between model construction and churn prediction. Using a previous demographics-based churn-prediction system as a reference the lift factors attained by our proposed technique appear largely satisfactory,"['telecommunications call details', 'mobile telecommunications industry', 'mobile service providers', 'deregulation', 'customer retention efforts', 'customer demographics', 'subscriber contractual information', 'call pattern changes', 'multi-classifier class-combiner approach', 'skewed class distribution', 'lift factors', 'decision tree induction', 'data mining', 'decision trees', 'demography', 'mobile communication', 'telecommunication computing', 'very large databases']",230,18

It can correctly take advantage of the situations and methods in former cases to find out suitable solutions for new problems. CBR must accurately retrieve similar prior cases for getting a good performance. In the past many researchers proposed useful technologies to handle this problem. However the performance of retrieving similar cases may be greatly influenced by the number of cases.

162,181,Electromagnetics computations using the MPI parallel implementation of the steepest descent fast multipole method SDFMM The computational solution of large-scale linear systems of equations necessitates the use of fast algorithms but is also greatly enhanced by employing parallelization techniques. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the speedup achieved by the MPI message passing interface parallel implementation of the steepest descent fast multipole method SDFMM). Although this algorithm has already been optimized to take advantage of the structure of the physics of scattering problems there is still the opportunity to speed up the calculation by dividing tasks into components using multiple processors and solve them in parallel. The SDFMM has three bottlenecks ordered as 1 filling the sparse impedance matrix associated with the near-field method of moments interactions MoM 2 the matrix vector multiplications associated with this sparse matrix and 3 the far field interactions associated with the fast multipole method. The parallel implementation task is accomplished using a thirty-one node Intel Pentium Beowulf cluster and is also validated on a 4-processor Alpha workstation. The Beowulf cluster consists of thirty-one nodes of 350 MHz Intel Pentium IIs with 256 MB of RAM and one node of a 4*450 MHz Intel Pentium II Xeon shared memory processor with 2 GB of RAM with all nodes connected to a 100 BaseTX Ethernet network. The Alpha workstation has a maximum of four 667 MHz processors. Our numerical results show significant linear speedup in filling the sparse impedance matrix.

Coppersmith and Sorkin conjectured that if X is generated by choosing each entry independently from the exponential distribution with mean 1 then the expected value of its minimum k-assignment is given by an explicit formula which has been proven only in a few cases. In this paper we describe our efforts to prove the Coppersmith-Sorkin conjecture by considering the more general situation where the entries x/sub ij of X are chosen independently from different distributions. In particular we require that x/sub ij be chosen from the exponential distribution with mean 1/r/sub i/c/sub j/.

166,185,Property testers for dense Constraint Satisfaction programs on finite domains Many NP-hard languages can be decided in subexponential time if the definition of decide is relaxed only slightly. Rubinfeld and Sudan introduced the notion of property testers probabilistic algorithms that can decide with high probability if a function has a certain property or if it is far from any function having this property. Goldreich Goldwasser and Ron constructed property testers with constant query complexity for dense instances of a large class of graph problems. Since many graph problems can be viewed as special cases of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem on Boolean domains it is natural to try to construct property testers for more general cases of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem.

168,187,Control of a thrust-vectored flying wing a receding horizon  LPV approach This paper deals with the application of receding horizon methods to hover and forward flight models of an experimental tethered flying wing developed at Caltech. The dynamics of the system are representative of a vertical landing and take off aircraft such as a Harrier around hover or a thrust-vectored aircraft such as F18-HARV or X-31 in forward flight. The adopted control methodology is a hybrid of receding horizon techniques and control Lyapunov function CLF)-based ideas. First a CLF is generated using quasi-LPV methods and then by using the CLF as the terminal cost in the receding horizon optimization stability is guaranteed. The main advantage of this approach is that stability can be guaranteed without imposing constraints in the on-line optimization allowing the problem to be solved in a more efficient manner. Models of the experimental set-up are obtained for the hover and forward flight modes. Numerical simulations for different time horizons are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the discussed methods. Specifically it is shown that a mere upper bound on the cost-to-go is not an appropriate choice for a terminal cost when the horizon length is short.

We assume that inputs outputs and the scheduling parameters are directly measured and a form of the functional dependence of the system coefficients on the parameters is known. We show how this identification problem can be reduced to a linear regression and provide compact formulae for the corresponding least mean square and recursive least-squares algorithms. We derive conditions on persistency of excitation in terms of the inputs and scheduling parameter trajectories when the functional dependence is of polynomial type. These conditions have a natural polynomial interpolation interpretation and do not require the scheduling parameter trajectories to vary slowly.

172,191,Linear parameter-varying control and its application to a turbofan engine This paper describes application of parameter-dependent control design methods to a turbofan engine. Parameter-dependent systems are linear systems whose state-space descriptions are known functions of time-varying parameters. The time variation of each of the parameters is not known in advance but is assumed to be measurable in real-time. Three linear parameter-varying LPV approaches to control design are discussed. The first method is based on linear fractional transformations which relies on the small gain theorem for bounds on performance and robustness. The other methods make use of either a single SQLF or parameter-dependent PDQLF quadratic Lyapunov function to bound the achievable level of performance. The latter two techniques are used to synthesize controllers for a high-performance turbofan engine. A LPV model of the turbofan engine is constructed from Jacobian linearizations at fixed power codes for control design. The control problem is formulated as a model matching problem in the H/sub infinity  and LPV framework.

177,196,On the emergence of rules in neural networks A simple associationist neural network learns to factor abstract rules i.e. grammars from sequences of arbitrary input symbols by inventing abstract representations that accommodate unseen symbol sets as well as unseen but similar grammars. The neural network is shown to have the ability to transfer grammatical knowledge to both new symbol vocabularies and new grammars. Analysis of the state-space shows that the network learns generalized abstract structures of the input and is not simply memorizing the input strings. These representations are context sensitive hierarchical and based on the state variable of the finite-state machines that the neural network has learned. Generalization to new symbol sets or grammars arises from the spatial nature of the internal representations used by the network allowing new symbol sets to be encoded close to symbol sets that have already been learned in the hidden unit space of the network. The results are counter to the arguments that learning algorithms based on weight adaptation after each exemplar presentation such as the long term potentiation found in the mammalian nervous system cannot in principle extract symbolic knowledge from positive examples as prescribed by prevailing human linguistic theory and evolutionary psychology,"['associationist neural network', 'learns', 'abstract rules', 'neural network', 'state-space', 'symbolic knowledge', 'cognitive neurosciences', 'associationist learning', 'associative processing', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'neural nets']",201,11

The model estimates the posterior probability of class membership similar to a mixture of experts classifier. In order to learn the parameters of the model we have developed a general training approach based on maximum likelihood that results in two efficient training algorithms. Compared to other classification mixture models the proposed hierarchical model exhibits several advantages and provides improved classification performance as indicated by the experimental results,"['hierarchical mixture model', 'classification', 'data generation process', 'Bayes classifier', 'experts classifier', 'posterior probability of class membership', 'Bayes methods', 'pattern classification']",125,8
179,198,Computational capacity of an odorant discriminator the linear separability of curves We introduce and study an artificial neural network inspired by the probabilistic receptor affinity distribution model of olfaction. Our system consists of N sensory neurons whose outputs converge on a single processing linear threshold element. The system's aim is to model discrimination of a single target odorant from a large number p of background odorants within a range of odorant concentrations. We show that this is possible provided p does not exceed a critical value p/sub c and calculate the critical capacity alpha c=p/sub c//N. The critical capacity depends on the range of concentrations in which the discrimination is to be accomplished. If the olfactory bulb may be thought of as a collection of such processing elements each responsible for the discrimination of a single odorant our study provides a quantitative analysis of the potential computational properties of the olfactory bulb. The mathematical formulation of the problem we consider is one of determining the capacity for linear separability of continuous curves embedded in a large-dimensional space. This is accomplished here by a numerical study using a method that signals whether the discrimination task is realizable together with a finite-size scaling analysis,"['artificial neural network', 'receptor affinity distribution', 'olfaction', 'linear threshold element', 'sensory neurons', 'linear separability', 'odorant discriminator', 'chemioception', 'neural nets']",202,9
180,199,On optimality in auditory information processing We study limits for the detection and estimation of weak sinusoidal signals in the primary part of the mammalian auditory system using a stochastic Fitzhugh-Nagumo model and an action-recovery model for synaptic depression. Our overall model covers the chain from a hair cell to a point just after the synaptic connection with a cell in the cochlear nucleus. The information processing performance of the system is evaluated using so-called phi divergences from statistics that quantify dissimilarity between probability measures and are intimately related to a number of fundamental limits in statistics and information theory IT). We show that there exists a set of parameters that can optimize several important phi divergences simultaneously and that this set corresponds to a constant quiescent firing rate QFR of the spiral ganglion neuron. The optimal value of the QFR is frequency dependent but is essentially independent of the amplitude of the signal for small amplitudes). Consequently optimal processing according to several standard IT criteria can be accomplished for this model if and only if the parameters are tuned to values that correspond to one and the same QFR. This offers a new explanation for the QFR and can provide new insight into the role played by several other parameters of the peripheral auditory system,"['weak sinusoidal signals', 'mammalian auditory system', 'stochastic Fitzhugh-Nagumo model', 'action-recovery model', 'peripheral auditory system', 'quiescent firing rate', 'spiral ganglion neuron', 'brain', 'brain models', 'dendrites', 'hearing', 'neural nets']",216,12
181,200,Preintegration lateral inhibition enhances unsupervised learning A large and influential class of neural network architectures uses postintegration lateral inhibition as a mechanism for competition. We argue that these algorithms are computationally deficient in that they fail to generate or learn appropriate perceptual representations under certain circumstances. An alternative neural network architecture is presented here in which nodes compete for the right to receive inputs rather than for the right to generate outputs. This form of competition implemented through preintegration lateral inhibition does provide appropriate coding properties and can be used to learn such representations efficiently. Furthermore this architecture is consistent with both neuroanatomical and neuropsychological data. We thus argue that preintegration lateral inhibition has computational advantages over conventional neural network architectures while remaining equally biologically plausible,"['neural network architectures', 'postintegration lateral inhibition', 'competition', 'preintegration lateral inhibition', 'neural network', 'unsupervised learning', 'neural net architecture', 'neural nets', 'unsupervised learning']",126,9

183,202,Estimation of error in curvature computation on multi-scale free-form surfaces A novel technique for multi-scale curvature computation on a free-form 3-D surface is presented. This is achieved by convolving local parametrisations of the surface with 2-D Gaussian filters iteratively. In our technique semigeodesic coordinates are constructed at each vertex of the mesh. Smoothing results are shown for 3-D surfaces with different shapes indicating that surface noise is eliminated and surface details are removed gradually. A number of evolution properties of 3-D surfaces are described. Next the surface Gaussian and mean curvature values are estimated accurately at multiple scales which are then mapped to colours and displayed directly on the surface. The performance of the technique when selecting different directions as an arbitrary direction for the geodesic at each vertex are also presented. The results indicate that the error observed for the estimation of Gaussian and mean curvatures is quite low after only one iteration. Furthermore as the surface is smoothed iteratively the error is further reduced. The results also show that the estimation error of Gaussian curvature is less than that of mean curvature. Our experiments demonstrate that estimation of smoothed surface curvatures are very accurate and not affected by the arbitrary direction of the first geodesic line when constructing semigeodesic coordinates. Our technique is independent of the underlying triangulation and is also more efficient than volumetric diffusion techniques since 2-D rather than 3-D convolutions are employed. Finally the method presented here is a generalisation of the Curvature Scale Space method for 2-D contours. The CSS method has outperformed comparable techniques within the MPEG-7 evaluation framework. As a result it has been selected for inclusion in the MPEG-7 package of standards,"['multi-scale curvature computation', 'free-form 3D surface', 'local parametrisations', '2D Gaussian filters', 'surface noise', 'evolution properties', 'surface Gaussian values', 'mean curvature values', 'semigeodesic coordinates', 'underlying triangulation', 'volumetric diffusion techniques', 'convolutions', 'Curvature Scale Space method', 'MPEG-7 evaluation framework', 'computational geometry', 'computer vision', 'object recognition']",281,17
184,203,Plenoptic image editing This paper presents a new class of interactive image editing operations designed to maintain consistency between multiple images of a physical 3D scene. The distinguishing feature of these operations is that edits to any one image propagate automatically to all other images as if the unknown 3D scene had itself been modified. The modified scene can then be viewed interactively from any other camera viewpoint and under different scene illuminations. The approach is useful first as a power-assist that enables a user to quickly modify many images by editing just a few and second as a means for constructing and editing image-based scene representations by manipulating a set of photographs. The approach works by extending operations like image painting scissoring and morphing so that they alter a scene's plenoptic function in a physically-consistent way thereby affecting scene appearance from all viewpoints simultaneously. A key element in realizing these operations is a new volumetric decomposition technique for reconstructing an scene's plenoptic function from an incomplete set of camera viewpoints,"['interactive image editing operations', 'multiple images', 'physical 3D scene', 'modified scene', 'camera viewpoint', 'image-based scene representations', 'image painting', 'scissoring', 'morphing', 'plenoptic function', 'volumetric decomposition technique', 'plenoptic image editing', 'image morphing', 'rendering (computer graphics)']",171,14
185,204,Self-calibration from image derivatives This study investigates the problem of estimating camera calibration parameters from image motion fields induced by a rigidly moving camera with unknown parameters where the image formation is modeled with a linear pinhole-camera model. The equations obtained show the flow to be separated into a component due to the translation and the calibration parameters and a component due to the rotation and the calibration parameters. A set of parameters encoding the latter component is linearly related to the flow and from these parameters the calibration can be determined. However as for discrete motion in general it is not possible to decouple image measurements obtained from only two frames into translational and rotational components. Geometrically the ambiguity takes the form of a part of the rotational component being parallel to the translational component and thus the scene can be reconstructed only up to a projective transformation. In general for full calibration at least four successive image frames are necessary with the 3D rotation changing between the measurements. The geometric analysis gives rise to a direct self-calibration method that avoids computation of optical flow or point correspondences and uses only normal flow measurements. New constraints on the smoothness of the surfaces in view are formulated to relate structure and motion directly to image derivatives and on the basis of these constraints the transformation of the viewing geometry between consecutive images is estimated. The calibration parameters are then estimated from the rotational components of several flow fields. As the proposed technique neither requires a special set up nor needs exact correspondence it is potentially useful for the calibration of active vision systems which have to acquire knowledge about their intrinsic parameters while they perform other tasks or as a tool for analyzing image sequences in large video databases,"['camera calibration parameters', 'image motion fields', 'rigidly moving camera', 'image formation', 'linear pinhole-camera model', 'calibration parameters', 'image measurements', 'translational components', 'rotational components', 'direct self-calibration method', 'optical flow', 'point correspondences', 'normal flow measurements', 'active vision systems', 'image sequences', 'large video databases', 'depth distortion', 'active vision', 'calibration', 'image motion analysis', 'image sequences', 'motion estimation']",299,22
186,205,Geotensity combining motion and lighting for 3D surface reconstruction This paper is about automatically reconstructing the full 3D surface of an object observed in motion by a single static camera. Based on the two paradigms structure from motion and linear intensity subspaces we introduce the geotensity constraint that governs the relationship between four or more images of a moving object. We show that it is possible in theory to solve for 3D Lambertian surface structure for the case of a single point light source and propose that a solution exists for an arbitrary number point light sources. The surface may or may not be textured. We then give an example of automatic surface reconstruction of a face under a point light source using arbitrary unknown object motion and a single fixed camera,"['full 3D surface', 'single static camera', 'linear intensity subspaces', 'geotensity constraint', '3D Lambertian surface structure', 'single point light source', 'arbitrary number point light sources', 'automatic surface reconstruction', 'point light source', 'linear image subspaces', 'structure-from-motion', 'computer vision', 'image reconstruction']",132,13
187,206,Information architecture looking ahead It may be a bit strange to consider where the field of information architecture IA is headed. After all many would argue that it's too new to be considered as a field at all or that it is mislabeled and by no means is there a widely accepted definition of what information architecture actually is. Practicing information architects probably number in the thousands and this vibrant group is already building various forms of communal infrastructure ranging from an IA journal and a self-organizing library of resources to a passel of local professional groups and degree-granting academic programs.

191,210,When a better interface and easy navigation aren't enough examining the information architecture in a law enforcement agency An information architecture that allows users to easily navigate through a system and quickly recover from mistakes is often defined as a highly usable system. But usability in systems design goes beyond a good interface and efficient navigation. In this article we describe two database systems in a law enforcement agency. One system is a legacy text-based system with cumbersome navigation RMS the newer system is a graphical user interface with simplified navigation CopNet). It is hypothesized that law enforcement users will evaluate CopNet higher than RMS but experts of the older system will evaluate it higher than others will. We conducted two user studies. One study examined what users thought of RMS and CopNet and compared RMS experts evaluations with nonexperts. We found that all users evaluated CopNet as more effective easier to use and easier to navigate than RMS and this was especially noticeable for users who were not experts with the older system. The second follow-up study examined use behavior after CopNet was deployed some time later. The findings revealed that evaluations of CopNet were not associated with its use. If the newer system had a better interface and was easier to navigate than the older legacy system why were law enforcement personnel reluctant to switch We discuss reasons why switching to a new system is difficult especially for those who are most adept at using the older system. Implications for system design and usability are also discussed,"['information architecture', 'law enforcement agency', 'legacy text-based system', 'RMS', 'graphical user interface', 'simplified navigation', 'CopNet', 'law enforcement users', 'graphical user interfaces', 'information systems', 'police data processing']",259,11

196,215,A conceptual framework for evaluation of information technology investments The decision to acquire a new information technology poses a number of serious evaluation and selection problems to technology managers because the new system must not only meet current information requirements of the organisation but also the needs for future expansion. Tangible and intangible benefits factors as well as risks factors must be identified and evaluated. The paper provides a review of ten major evaluation categories and available models which fall under each category showing their advantages and disadvantages in handling the above difficulties. This paper describes strategic implications involved in the selection decision and the inherent difficulties in 1 choosing or developing a model 2 obtaining realistic inputs for the model and 3 making tradeoffs among the conflicting factors. It proposes a conceptual framework to help the decision maker in choosing the most appropriate methodology in the evaluation process. It also offers a new model called GAHP for the evaluation problem combining integer goal linear programming and analytic hierarchy process AHP in a single hybrid multiple objective multi-criteria model. A goal programming methodology with zero-one integer variables and mixed integer constraints is used to set goal target values against which information technology alternatives are evaluated and selected. AHP is used to structure the evaluation process providing pairwise comparison mechanisms to quantify subjective nonmonetary intangible benefits and risks factors in deriving data for the model.

These data for various dimensions of the raindrops mean effective radius from 0 to 3.25 mm frequencies 10 to 80 GHz horizontal and vertical polarizations and temperatures 0 10 and 20 degrees C are stored to establish a data bank. Furthermore a curve fitting technique i.e. interpolation of order 3 is implemented for the TCS values in the data bank. Therefore the interpolated TCS results can be obtained readily from the interpolation process with negligible or even null computational time and efforts.

211,232,Library services today and tomorrow lessons from iLumina a digital library for creating and sharing teaching resources This article is based on the emerging experience associated with a digital library of instructional resources iLumina in which the contributors of resources and the users of those resources are the same-an open community of instructors in science mathematics engineering and technology. Moreover it is not the resources most of which will be distributed across the Internet but metadata about the resources that is the focus of the central iLumina repository and its support services for resource contributors and users. The distributed iLumina library is a community-sharing library for repurposing and adding value to potentially useful mostly non-commercial instructional resources that are typically more granular in nature than commercially developed course materials. The experience of developing iLumina is raising a range of issues that have nothing to do with the place and time characteristics of the instructional context in which iLumina instructional resources are created or used. The issues instead have their locus in the democratization of both the professional roles of librarians and the quality assurance mechanisms associated with traditional peer review,"['iLumina', 'digital library', 'teaching resource sharing', 'Internet', 'metadata', 'information resources', 'community-sharing library', 'professional roles', 'academic library', 'librarians', 'quality assurance', 'peer review', 'library automation', 'standards', 'interoperability', 'reusable software', 'distributed systems', 'user issues', 'academic libraries', 'digital libraries', 'educational computing', 'information resources', 'Internet', 'meta data']",190,24

217,238,The Open Archives Initiative realizing simple and effective digital library interoperability The Open Archives Initiative OAI is dedicated to solving problems of digital library interoperability. Its focus has been on defining simple protocols most recently for the exchange of metadata from archives. The OAI evolved out of a need to increase access to scholarly publications by supporting the creation of interoperable digital libraries. As a first step towards such interoperability a metadata harvesting protocol was developed to support the streaming of metadata from one repository to another ultimately to a provider of user services such as browsing searching or annotation. This article provides an overview of the mission philosophy and technical framework of the OAI,"['Open Archives Initiative', 'digital library interoperability', 'protocols', 'exchange metadata', 'scholarly publications', 'metadata harvesting protocol', 'streaming metadata', 'annotation', 'searching', 'browsing', 'user services', 'digital libraries', 'electronic publishing', 'meta data', 'open systems', 'protocols']",115,16
218,239,Content standards for electronic books the OEBF publication structure and the role of public interest participation In the emerging world of electronic publishing how we create distribute and read books will be in a large part determined by an underlying framework of content standards that establishes the range of technological opportunities and constraints for publishing and reading systems. But efforts to develop content standards based on sound engineering models must skillfully negotiate competing and sometimes apparently irreconcilable objectives if they are to produce results relevant to the rapidly changing course of technology. The Open eBook Forum's Publication Structure an XML-based specification for electronic books is an example of the sort of timely and innovative problem solving required for successful real-world standards development. As a result of this effort the electronic book industry will not only happen sooner and on a larger scale than it would have otherwise but the electronic books it produces will be more functional more interoperable and more accessible to all readers.

224,245,Support vector machines model for classification of thermal error in machine tools This paper addresses a change in the concept of machine tool thermal error prediction which has been hitherto carried out by directly mapping them with the temperature of critical elements on the machine. The model developed herein using support vector machines a powerful data-training algorithm seeks to account for the impact of specific operating conditions in addition to temperature variation on the effective prediction of thermal errors. Several experiments were conducted to study the error pattern which was found to change significantly with variation in operating conditions. This model attempts to classify the error based on operating conditions. Once classified the error is then predicted based on the temperature states. This paper also briefly describes the concept of the implementation of such a comprehensive model along with an on-line error assessment and calibration system in a PC-based open-architecture controller environment so that it could be employed in regular production for the purpose of periodic calibration of machine tools,"['SVM', 'support vector machines model', 'thermal error classification', 'machine tool thermal error prediction', 'critical element temperature', 'data-training algorithm', 'error pattern', 'online error assessment', 'online calibration system', 'PC-based open-architecture controller environment', 'calibration', 'errors', 'factory automation', 'learning automata', 'machine tools', 'mechanical engineering computing', 'microcomputer applications', 'pattern classification']",170,18
225,246,Adaptive and efficient mutual exclusion The paper presents adaptive algorithms for mutual exclusion using only read and write operations the performance of the algorithms depends only on the point contention i.e. the number of processes that are concurrently active during algorithm execution and not on n the total number of processes). Our algorithm has O(k remote step complexity and O(log k system response time where k is the point contention. The remote step complexity is the maximal number of steps performed by a process where a wait is counted as one step. The system response time is the time interval between subsequent entries to the critical section where one time unit is the minimal interval in which every active process performs at least one step. The space complexity of this algorithm is O(N log n where N is the range of process names. We show how to make the space complexity of our algorithm depend solely on n while preserving the other performance measures of the algorithm,"['adaptive mutual exclusion', 'adaptive algorithms', 'read operations', 'write operations', 'point contention', 'algorithm execution', 'remote step complexity', 'system response time', 'critical section', 'minimal interval', 'active process', 'space complexity', 'performance measures', 'adaptive systems', 'computational complexity', 'distributed algorithms', 'shared memory systems']",167,17
226,247,The congenial talking philosophers problem in computer networks Group mutual exclusion occurs naturally in situations where a resource can be shared by processes of the same group but not by processes of different groups. For example suppose data is stored in a CD-jukebox. Then when a disc is loaded for access users that need data on the disc can concurrently access the disc while users that need data on a different disc have to wait until the current disc is unloaded. The design issues for group mutual exclusion have been modeled as the Congenial Talking Philosophers problem and solutions for shared memory models have been proposed Y.-J. Young 2000 P. Keane and M. Moir 1999). As in ordinary mutual exclusion and many other problems in distributed systems however techniques developed for shared memory do not necessarily apply to message passing and vice versa). We investigate solutions for Congenial Talking Philosophers in computer networks where processes communicate by asynchronous message passing. We first present a solution that is a straightforward adaptation from G. Ricart and A.K. Agrawala's 1981 algorithm for ordinary mutual exclusion. Then we show that the simple modification suffers a severe performance degradation that could cause the system to behave as though only one process of a group can be in the critical section at a time. We then present a more efficient and highly concurrent distributed algorithm for the problem the first such solution in computer networks,"['congenial talking philosophers problem', 'computer networks', 'group mutual exclusion', 'resource sharing', 'shared-memory models', 'distributed systems', 'process communication', 'asynchronous message passing', 'critical section', 'concurrent distributed algorithm', 'computer networks', 'concurrency control', 'distributed algorithms', 'message passing', 'processor scheduling', 'resource allocation', 'shared memory systems']",239,17
227,248,Universal dynamic synchronous self-stabilization We prove the existence of a universal synchronous self-stabilizing protocol that is a protocol that allows a distributed system to stabilize to a desired nonreactive behaviour as long as a protocol stabilizing to that behaviour exists). Previous proposals required drastic increases in asymmetry and knowledge to work whereas our protocol does not use any additional knowledge and does not require more symmetry-breaking conditions than available thus it is also stabilizing with respect to dynamic changes in the topology. We prove an optimal quiescence time n + D for a synchronous network of n processors and diameter D the protocol can be made finite state with a negligible loss in quiescence time. Moreover an optimal D + 1 protocol is given for the case of unique identifiers. As a consequence we provide an effective proof technique that allows one to show whether self-stabilization to a certain behaviour is possible under a wide range of models,"['universal dynamic synchronous self-stabilization', 'synchronous self-stabilizing protocol', 'distributed system', 'nonreactive behaviour', 'topology', 'dynamic changes', 'optimal quiescence time', 'synchronous network', 'finite state', 'quiescence time', 'optimal protocol', 'unique identifiers', 'proof technique', 'self-stabilization', 'anonymous networks', 'graph fibrations', 'distributed processing', 'protocols', 'self-adjusting systems', 'theorem proving']",158,20

231,252,Reaching for five nines ActiveWatch and SiteSeer Every Web admin's dream is achieving the fabled five nines-99.999 percent uptime. To attain such availability your Web site must be down no more than about five minutes per year. Technologies like RAID clustering and load balancing make this easier but to actually track uptime maintain auditable records and discover patterns in failures to prevent downtime in the future you'll need to set up external monitoring. Because your Internet connection is a key factor in measuring uptime you must monitor your site from the Internet itself beyond your firewall. You could monitor with custom software on remote hosts or you could use one of the two reasonably priced services available Mercury Interactive's ActiveWatch and Freshwater Software's SiteSeer. Freshwater Software has been a subsidiary of Mercury Interactive for about a year now. The two services offer a slightly different mix of features and target different markets.

240,261,Union outreach  a pilgrim's progress As the American labor movement continues on its path toward reorganization and rejuvenation archivists are challenged to ensure that the organizational political and cultural changes labor unions are experiencing are fully documented. The article examines the need for labor archivists to reach out actively to unions and the problems they face in getting their message across not only to union leadership but also to union members. Outreach by labor archivists is vital on three critical fronts the need to secure union funding in support of labor archival programs obtaining union cooperation in reviewing and amending obsolete deposit agreements and coordinating efforts with unions to save the records of closing district and local union offices. Attempting to resolve these outstanding issues labor archivists are pulled between two distinct institutional cultures one academic in nature the other enmeshed in a union bureaucracy and often have their own labor archival programs compromised by the internal dynamics and politics inherent in administering large academic libraries and unions. If labor archivists are to be successful they must find their collective voice within the labor movement and establish their relevancy to unions during a period of momentous change and restructuring. Moreover archivists need to give greater thought to designing and implementing outreach programs that bridge the fundamental disconnect between union bureaucracies and the rank and file and unions and the public,"['American labor movement', 'archivists', 'political changes', 'cultural changes', 'labor unions', 'labor archivists', 'union leadership', 'union members', 'union funding', 'labor archival programs', 'union cooperation', 'obsolete deposit agreements', 'union offices', 'institutional cultures', 'union bureaucracy', 'internal dynamics', 'large academic libraries', 'collective voice', 'information retrieval systems', 'politics', 'records management', 'service industries']",230,22

243,264,The archival imagination of David Bearman revisited Many archivists regard the archival imagination evidenced in the writings of David Bearman as avant-garde. Archivist L. Henry 1998 has sharply criticized Bearman for being irreverent toward the archival theory and practice outlined by classical American archivist T. R. Schellenberg. Although Bearman is sometimes credited and sometimes berated for establishing a new paradigm centered on the archival management of electronic records his methods and strategies are intended to encompass all forms of record keeping. The article provides general observations on Bearman's archival imagination lists some of its components and addresses elements of Henry's critique.

The definition and the calculation method for these properties are reviewed. The surface is segmented into overlapping patches with similar molecular properties. These patches can be used to represent the characteristic local features of the molecule in a way that is beyond the atomistic resolution but can nevertheless be applied for the analysis of partial similarities of different molecules as well as for the identification of molecular complementarity in a very general sense. The patch representation can be used for different applications which will be demonstrated in subsequent articles,"['pattern recognition strategies', 'molecular surfaces', 'pattern generation', 'fuzzy set theory', 'model approach', 'topographical properties', 'electrostatic potential', 'local lipophilicity/hydrophilicity', 'hydrogen bond density', 'segmented surface', 'overlapping patches', 'molecular properties', 'local features', 'atomistic resolution', 'partial similarities', 'molecular complementarity', 'patch representation', 'lipophilicity', 'hydrophilicity', 'fuzzy logic', 'fuzzy set theory', 'hydrogen bonds', 'intermolecular mechanics', 'molecular biophysics', 'pattern classification', 'pattern recognition', 'potential energy functions']",147,27
246,267,An efficient parallel algorithm for the calculation of canonical MP2 energies We present the parallel version of a previous serial algorithm for the efficient calculation of canonical MP2 energies. It is based on the Saebo-Almlof direct-integral transformation coupled with an efficient prescreening of the AO integrals. The parallel algorithm avoids synchronization delays by spawning a second set of slaves during the bin-sort prior to the second half-transformation. Results are presented for systems with up to 2000 basis functions. MP2 energies for molecules with 400-500 basis functions can be routinely calculated to microhartree accuracy on a small number of processors 6-8 in a matter of minutes with modern PC-based parallel computers,"['parallel algorithm', 'canonical MP2 energies', 'Saebo-Almlof direct-integral transformation', 'AO integrals', 'synchronization delays', 'second half-transformation', 'basis functions', 'MP2 energies', 'microhartree accuracy', 'PC-based parallel computers', 'chemistry computing', 'orbital calculations', 'parallel algorithms', 'physics computing', 'transforms']",110,15
247,268,A method for correlations analysis of coordinates applications for molecular conformations We describe a new method to analyze multiple correlations between subsets of coordinates that represent a sample. The correlation is established only between specific regions of interest at the coordinates. First the region(s of interest are selected at each molecular coordinate. Next a correlation matrix is constructed for the selected regions. The matrix is subject to further analysis illuminating the multidimensional structural characteristics that exist in the conformational space. The method's abilities are demonstrated in several examples it is used to analyze the conformational space of complex molecules it is successfully applied to compare related conformational spaces and it is used to analyze a diverse set of protein folding trajectories,"['multiple correlation analysis', 'regions of interest', 'correlation matrix', 'molecular coordinate', 'multidimensional structural characteristics', 'complex molecules', 'conformational spaces', 'protein folding trajectories', 'molecular conformations', 'biology computing', 'macromolecules', 'molecular biophysics', 'molecular configurations', 'proteins']",121,14
248,269,Genetic algorithm guided selection variable selection and subset selection A novel genetic algorithm guided selection method GAS has been described. The method utilizes a simple encoding scheme which can represent both compounds and variables used to construct a QSAR/QSPR model. A genetic algorithm is then utilized to simultaneously optimize the encoded variables that include both descriptors and compound subsets. The GAS method generates multiple models each applying to a subset of the compounds. Typically the subsets represent clusters with different chemotypes. Also a procedure based on molecular similarity is presented to determine which model should be applied to a given test set compound. The variable selection method implemented in GAS has been tested and compared using the Selwood data set n = 31 compounds nu = 53 descriptors). The results showed that the method is comparable to other published methods. The subset selection method implemented in GAS has been first tested using an artificial data set n = 100 points nu = 1 descriptor to examine its ability to subset data points and second applied to analyze the XLOGP data set n = 1831 compounds nu = 126 descriptors). The method is able to correctly identify artificial data points belonging to various subsets. The analysis of the XLOGP data set shows that the subset selection method can be useful in improving a QSAR/QSPR model when the variable selection method fails,"['genetic algorithm guided selection method', 'encoding scheme', 'compounds', 'variables', 'variable selection', 'subset selection', 'QSAR/QSPR model', 'optimization', 'descriptors', 'compound subsets', 'multiple models', 'clusters', 'chemotypes', 'molecular similarity', 'Selwood data set', 'XLOGP data set', 'artificial data points', 'biology computing', 'chemical structure', 'chemistry computing', 'genetic algorithms']",230,21
249,270,Using molecular equivalence numbers to visually explore structural features that distinguish chemical libraries A molecular equivalence number meqnum classifies a molecule with respect to a class of structural features or topological shapes such as its cyclic system or its set of functional groups. Meqnums can be used to organize molecular structures into nonoverlapping yet highly relatable classes. We illustrate the construction of some different types of meqnums and present via examples some methods of comparing diverse chemical libraries based on meqnums. In the examples we compare a library which is a random sample from the MDL Drug Data Report MDDR with a library which is a random sample from the Available Chemical Directory ACD). In our analyses we discover some interesting features of the topological shape of a molecule and its set of functional groups that are strongly linked with compounds occurring in the MDDR but not in the ACD. We also illustrate the utility of molecular equivalence indices in delineating the structural domain over which an SAR conclusion is valid,"['molecular equivalence number', 'molecule classification', 'structural features', 'topological shapes', 'cyclic system', 'functional groups', 'nonoverlapping relatable classes', 'chemical libraries', 'MDL Drug Data Report', 'Available Chemical Directory', 'molecular equivalence indices', 'biology computing', 'chemical structure', 'chemistry computing', 'equivalence classes', 'medical computing', 'medical information systems', 'molecular configurations', 'organic compounds', 'pharmaceutical industry', 'scientific information systems', 'special libraries']",171,22
250,271,On the use of neural network ensembles in QSAR and QSPR Despite their growing popularity among neural network practitioners ensemble methods have not been widely adopted in structure-activity and structure-property correlation. Neural networks are inherently unstable in that small changes in the training set and/or training parameters can lead to large changes in their generalization performance. Recent research has shown that by capitalizing on the diversity of the individual models ensemble techniques can minimize uncertainty and produce more stable and accurate predictors. In this work we present a critical assessment of the most common ensemble technique known as bootstrap aggregation or bagging as applied to QSAR and QSPR. Although aggregation does offer definitive advantages we demonstrate that bagging may not be the best possible choice and that simpler techniques such as retraining with the full sample can often produce superior results. These findings are rationalized using Krogh and Vedelsby's 1995 decomposition of the generalization error into a term that measures the average generalization performance of the individual networks and a term that measures the diversity among them. For networks that are designed to resist over-fitting the benefits of aggregation are clear but not overwhelming,"['neural network ensembles', 'QSAR', 'QSPR', 'training set', 'training parameters', 'generalization performance', 'uncertainty', 'bootstrap aggregation', 'bagging', 'retraining', 'generalization error decomposition', 'structure-activity correlation', 'structure-property correlation', 'chemical structure', 'chemistry computing', 'generalisation (artificial intelligence)', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'neural nets', 'uncertainty handling']",194,19
251,272,Median partitioning a novel method for the selection of representative subsets from large compound pools A method termed median partitioning MP has been developed to select diverse sets of molecules from large compound pools. Unlike many other methods for subset selection the MP approach does not depend on pairwise comparison of molecules and can therefore be applied to very large compound collections. The only time limiting step is the calculation of molecular descriptors for database compounds. MP employs arrays of property descriptors with little correlation to divide large compound pools into partitions from which representative molecules can be selected. In each of n subsequent steps a population of molecules is divided into subpopulations above and below the median value of a property descriptor until a desired number of 2/sup n partitions are obtained. For descriptor evaluation and selection an entropy formulation was embedded in a genetic algorithm. MP has been applied to generate a subset of the Available Chemicals Directory and the results have been compared with cell-based partitioning,"['median partitioning', 'large compound pools', 'representative subset selection', 'molecules', 'time limiting step', 'molecular descriptors', 'database compounds', 'property descriptor array', 'entropy formulation', 'genetic algorithm', 'Available Chemicals Directory', 'cell-based partitioning', 'chemistry computing', 'entropy', 'genetic algorithms', 'organic compounds', 'scientific information systems', 'very large databases']",169,18
252,273,Chemical information based scaling of molecular descriptors a universal chemical scale for library design and analysis Scaling is a difficult issue for any analysis of chemical properties or molecular topology when disparate descriptors are involved. To compare properties across different data sets a common scale must be defined. Using several publicly available databases ACD CMC MDDR and NCI as a basis we propose to define chemically meaningful scales for a number of molecular properties and topology descriptors. These chemically derived scaling functions have several advantages. First it is possible to define chemically relevant scales greatly simplifying similarity and diversity analyses across data sets. Second this approach provides a convenient method for setting descriptor boundaries that define chemically reasonable topology spaces. For example descriptors can be scaled so that compounds with little potential for biological activity bioavailability or other drug-like characteristics are easily identified as outliers. We have compiled scaling values for 314 molecular descriptors. In addition the 10th and 90th percentile values for each descriptor have been calculated for use in outlier filtering,"['universal chemical scale', 'library design', 'library analysis', 'chemical information based scaling', 'molecular descriptors', 'molecular topology', 'chemical properties', 'databases', 'diversity analyses', 'similarity analyses', 'data sets', 'descriptor boundaries', 'drug-like characteristics', 'biological activity', 'bioavailability', 'outliers', 'biology computing', 'chemistry computing', 'medical computing', 'medical information systems', 'molecular biophysics', 'pharmaceutical industry', 'scientific information systems']",173,23

SAR QSAR Environ. Res. 2001 12 75-92 was applied to a series of 25 acetylcholinesterase hydrolysis substrates. Statistically significant MTD-PLS models q/sup 2 between 0.7 and 0.8 are in agreement with previous MTD models with the advantage that local contributions are understood beyond the occupancy/nonoccupancy interpretation in MTD. A chemically intuitive approach further forces MTD-PLS coefficients to assume only negative or zero values for fragmental volume descriptors and positive or zero values for fragmental hydrophobicity descriptors.

254,275,Prediction of ultraviolet spectral absorbance using quantitative structure-property relationships High performance liquid chromatography HPLC with ultraviolet UV spectrophotometric detection is a common method for analyzing reaction products in organic chemistry. This procedure would benefit from a computational model for predicting the relative response of organic molecules. Models are now reported for the prediction of the integrated UV absorbance for a diverse set of organic compounds using a quantitative structure-property relationship QSPR approach. A seven-descriptor linear correlation with a squared correlation coefficient R/sup 2 of 0.815 is reported for a data set of 521.compounds. Using the sum of ZINDO oscillator strengths in the integration range as an additional descriptor allowed reduction in the number of descriptors producing a robust model for 460 compounds with five descriptors and a squared correlation coefficient 0.857.

255,276,Assessment of the macrocyclic effect for the complexation of crown-ethers with alkali cations using the substructural molecular fragments method The Substructural Molecular Fragments method Solov'ev V. P. Varnek A. A. Wipff G. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 2000 40 847-858 was applied to assess stability constants logK of the complexes of crown-ethers polyethers and glymes with Na/sup + K/sup + and Cs/sup + in methanol. One hundred forty-seven computational models including different fragment sets coupled with linear or nonlinear fitting equations were applied for the data sets containing 69 Na/sup + 123 K/sup + and 31 Cs/sup + compounds. To account for the macrocyclic effect for crown-ethers an additional cyclicity descriptor was used. Predicted stability constants both for macrocyclic compounds and for their open-chain analogues are in good agreement with the experimental data reported earlier and with those studied experimentally in this work.

256,277,Improving the predicting power of partial order based QSARs through linear extensions Partial order theory POT is an attractive and operationally simple method that allows ordering of compounds based on selected structural and/or electronic descriptors modeled order or based on their end points e.g. solubility experimental order). If the modeled order resembles the experimental order compounds that are not experimentally investigated can be assigned a position in the model that eventually might lead to a prediction of an end-point value. However in the application of POT in quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling only the compounds directly comparable to the noninvestigated compounds are applied. To explore the possibilities of improving the methodology the theory is extended by application of the so-called linear extensions of the model order. The study show that partial ordering combined with linear extensions appears as a promising tool providing probability distribution curves in the range of possible end-point values for compounds not being experimentally investigated,"['quantitative structure-activity relationships', 'partial order theory', 'predicting power improvement', 'linear extensions', 'structural descriptors', 'electronic descriptors', 'modeled order', 'end points', 'graphical representation', 'combinatorial rule', 'most probable linear order', 'partially ordered set', 'Hasse diagram', 'solubilities', 'organic compounds', 'chemistry computing', 'combinatorial mathematics', 'organic compounds', 'physical chemistry', 'probability', 'set theory', 'solubility']",157,22
257,278,Novel ZE-isomerism descriptors derived from molecular topology and their application to QSAR analysis We introduce several series of novel ZE-isomerism descriptors derived directly from two-dimensional molecular topology. These descriptors make use of a quantity named ZE-isomerism correction which is added to the vertex degrees of atoms connected by double bonds in Z and E configurations. This approach is similar to the one described previously for topological chirality descriptors Golbraikh A. et al. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 2001 41 147-158). The ZE-isomerism descriptors include modified molecular connectivity indices overall Zagreb indices extended connectivity overall connectivity and topological charge indices. They can be either real or complex numbers. Mathematical properties of different subgroups of ZE-isomerism descriptors are discussed. These descriptors circumvent the inability of conventional topological indices to distinguish between Z and E isomers.

Four classes of ninth and tenth-grade honors students N = 100 participated in an Internet inquiry project in which they were presented with an ecology question that required them to make a decision based on information that they gathered analyzed and synthesized from the Internet and their textbook. Students then composed papers with a rationale for their decision. Students in one group had access to pre-selected relevant Web sites access to the entire Internet and were provided with less online support. Students in the other group had access to only pre-selected relevant Web sites but were provided with more online support.

264,285,Presentation media information complexity and learning outcomes Multimedia computing provides a variety of information presentation modality combinations. Educators have observed that visuals enhance learning which suggests that multimedia presentations should be superior to text-only and text with static pictures in facilitating optimal human information processing and therefore comprehension. The article reports the findings from a 3 text-only overhead slides and multimedia presentation)*2 high and low information complexity factorial experiment. Subjects read a text script viewed an acetate overhead slide presentation or viewed a multimedia presentation depicting the greenhouse effect low complexity or photocopier operation high complexity). Multimedia was superior to text-only and overhead slides for comprehension. Information complexity diminished comprehension and perceived presentation quality. Multimedia was able to reduce the negative impact of information complexity on comprehension and increase the extent of sustained attention to the presentation. These findings suggest that multimedia presentations invoke the use of both the verbal and visual working memory channels resulting in a reduction of the cognitive load imposed by increased information complexity.

266,287,Loudspeaker voice-coil inductance losses circuit models parameter estimation and effect on frequency response When the series resistance is separated and treated as a separate element it is shown that losses in an inductor require the ratio of the flux to MMF in the core to be frequency dependent. For small-signal operation this dependence leads to a circuit model composed of a lossless inductor and a resistor in parallel both of which are frequency dependent. Mathematical expressions for these elements are derived under the assumption that the ratio of core flux to MMF varies as omega sup n-1 where n is a constant. A linear regression technique is described for extracting the model parameters from measured data. Experimental data are presented to justify the model for the lossy inductance of a loudspeaker voice-coil.

Using tools from statistical mechanics we are able to identify phase transitions in the structure of the solution space and to connect them to the changes in the performance of a global algorithm namely Gaussian elimination. Crossing phase boundaries produces a dramatic increase in memory and CPU requirements necessary for the algorithms. In turn this causes the saturation of the upper bounds for the running time.

271,292,Novel active noise-reducing headset using earshell vibration control Active noise-reducing ANR headsets are available commercially in applications varying from aviation communication to consumer audio. Current ANR systems use passive attenuation at high frequencies and loudspeaker-based active noise control at low frequencies to achieve broadband noise reduction. This paper presents a novel ANR headset in which the external noise transmitted to the user's ear via earshell vibration is reduced by controlling the vibration of the earshell using force actuators acting against an inertial mass or the earshell headband. Model-based theoretical analysis using velocity feedback control showed that current piezoelectric actuators provide sufficient force but require lower stiffness for improved low-frequency performance. Control simulations based on experimental data from a laboratory headset showed that good performance can potentially be achieved in practice by a robust feedback controller while a single-frequency real-time control experiment verified that noise reduction can be achieved using earshell vibration control,"['active noise-reducing headset', 'earshell vibration control', 'aviation communication', 'consumer audio', 'passive attenuation', 'broadband noise reduction', 'external noise transmission', 'force actuators', 'inertial mass', 'velocity feedback control', 'piezoelectric actuators', 'stiffness', 'robust feedback controller', 'single-frequency real-time control', 'acoustic field', 'acoustic transducers', 'acoustic wave absorption', 'acoustic wave transmission', 'active noise control', 'force feedback', 'piezoelectric transducers', 'robust control', 'vibration control']",152,23
272,293,Theoretical and experimental investigations on coherence of traffic noise transmission through an open window into a rectangular room in high-rise buildings A method for theoretically calculating the coherence between sound pressure inside a rectangular room in a high-rise building and that outside the open window of the room is proposed. The traffic noise transmitted into a room is generally dominated by low-frequency components to which active noise control ANC technology may find an application. However good coherence between reference and error signals is essential for an effective noise reduction and should be checked first. Based on traffic noise prediction methods wave theory and mode coupling theory the results of this paper enabled one to determine the potentials and limitations of ANC used to reduce such a transmission. Experimental coherence results are shown for two similar empty rectangular rooms located on the 17th and 30th floors of a 34 floor high-rise building. The calculated results with the proposed method are generally in good agreement with the experimental results and demonstrate the usefulness of the method for predicting the coherence,"['traffic noise transmission', 'open window', 'rectangular room', 'high-rise buildings', 'sound pressure', 'low-frequency components', 'active noise control technology', 'traffic noise prediction methods', 'mode coupling theory', 'wave theory', 'active noise control', 'architectural acoustics', 'noise pollution']",178,13

281,302,Using Internet search engines to estimate word frequency The present research investigated Internet search engines as a rapid cost-effective alternative for estimating word frequencies. Frequency estimates for 382 words were obtained and compared across four methods 1 Internet search engines 2 the Kucera and Francis 1967 analysis of a traditional linguistic corpus 3 the CELEX English linguistic database Baayen et al. 1995 and 4 participant ratings of familiarity. The results showed that Internet search engines produced frequency estimates that were highly consistent with those reported by Kucera and Francis and those calculated from CELEX highly consistent across search engines and very reliable over a 6 month period of time. Additional results suggested that Internet search engines are an excellent option when traditional word frequency analyses do not contain the necessary data e.g. estimates for forenames and slang). In contrast participants familiarity judgments did not correspond well with the more objective estimates of word frequency. Researchers are advised to use search engines with large databases e.g. AltaVista to ensure the greatest representativeness of the frequency estimates,"['Internet search engines', 'word frequency estimation', 'linguistic corpus', 'CELEX English linguistic database', 'participant familiarity ratings', 'large databases', 'Internet', 'linguistics', 'psychology', 'search engines']",175,10

285,306,Measuring keyboard response delays by comparing keyboard and joystick inputs The response characteristics of PC keyboards have to be identified when they are used as response devices in psychological experiments. In the past the proposed method has been to check the characteristics independently by means of external measurement equipment. However with the availability of different PC models and the rapid pace of model change there is an urgent need for the development of convenient and accurate methods of checking. The method proposed consists of raising the precision of the PC's clock to the microsecond level and using a joystick connected to the MIDI terminal of a sound board to give the PC an independent timing function. Statistical processing of the data provided by this method makes it possible to estimate accurately the keyboard scanning interval time and the average keyboard delay time. The results showed that measured keyboard delay times varied from 11 to 73 msec depending on the keyboard model with most values being less than 30 msec,"['keyboard response delay measurement', 'joystick inputs', 'keyboard inputs', 'PC keyboards', 'psychological experiments', 'model change', 'checking', 'PC clock precision', 'MIDI terminal', 'sound board', 'independent timing function', 'statistical data processing', 'keyboard scanning interval time', 'average keyboard delay time', 'interactive devices', 'keyboards', 'microcomputer applications', 'psychology']",169,18

292,313,Information architecture notes toward a new curriculum There are signs that information architecture is coalescing into a field of professional practice. However if it is to become a profession it must develop a means of educating new information architects. Lessons from other fields suggest that professional education typically evolves along a predictable path from apprenticeships to trade schools to college and university-level education. Information architecture education may develop more quickly to meet the growing demands of the information society. Several pedagogical approaches employed in other fields may be adopted for information architecture education as long as the resulting curricula provide an interdisciplinary approach and balance instruction in technical and design skills with consideration of theoretical concepts. Key content areas are information organization graphic. design computer science user and usability studies and communication. Certain logistics must be worked out including where information architecture studies should be housed and what kinds of degrees should be offered and at what levels.

293,314,Information architecture in JASIST just where did we come from The emergence of Information Architecture within the information systems world has been simultaneously drawn out yet rapid. Those with an eye on history are quick to point to Wurman's 1976 use of the term architecture of information but it has only been in the last 2 years that IA has become the source of sufficient interest for people to label themselves professionally as Information Architects. The impetus for this recent emergence of IA can be traced to a historical summit supported by ASIS&T in May 2000 at Boston. It was here that several hundred of us gathered to thrash out the questions of just what IA was and what this new field might become. At the time of the summit invited to present a short talk on my return journey from the annual ACM SIGCHI conference I entered the summit expecting little and convinced that IA was nothing new. I left 2 days later refreshed not just by the enthusiasm of the attendees for this term but by IA's potential to unify the disparate perspectives and orientations of professionals from a range of disciplines. It was at this summit that the idea for the special issue took root. I proposed the idea to Don Kraft hoping he would find someone else to run with it. AS luck would have it I ended up taking charge of it myself with initial support from David Blair. From the suggestion to the finished product-has been the best part of 2 years and in that time more than 50 volunteers reviewed over 20 submissions,"['information architecture', 'information systems', 'metadata fields', 'controlled vocabularies', 'Web sites', 'CD-ROM', 'qualified information architect', 'certification', 'hypermedia', 'information resources']",270,10
294,315,The impact of the Internet on public library use an analysis of the current consumer market for library and Internet services The potential impact of the Internet on the public's demand for the services and resources of public libraries is an issue of critical importance. The research reported in this article provides baseline data concerning the evolving relationship between the public's use of the library and its use of the Internet. The authors developed a consumer model of the American adult market for information services and resources segmented by use or nonuse of the public library and by access or lack of access to and use or nonuse of the Internet. A national Random Digit Dialing telephone survey collected data to estimate the size of each of six market segments and to describe their usage choices between the public library and the Internet. The analyses presented in this article provide estimates of the size and demographics of each of the market segments describe why people are currently using the public library and the Internet identify the decision criteria people use in their choices of which provider to use identify areas in which libraries and the Internet appear to be competing and areas in which they appear to be complementary and identify reasons why people choose not to use the public library and/or the Internet. The data suggest that some differentiation between the library and the Internet is taking place which may very well have an impact on consumer choices between the two. Longitudinal research is necessary to fully reveal trends in these usage choices which have implications for all types of libraries in planning and policy development,"['Internet', 'public libraries', 'baseline data', 'consumer model', 'American adult market', 'national Random Digit Dialing telephone survey', 'decision criteria', 'public library', 'longitudinal research', 'Internet', 'public libraries']",277,11
295,316,Duality revisited construction of fractional frequency distributions based on two dual Lotka laws Fractional frequency distributions of for example authors with a certain fractional number of papers are very irregular and therefore not easy to model or to explain. The article gives a first attempt to this by as suming two simple Lotka laws with exponent 2 one for the number of authors with n papers total count here and one for the number of papers with n authors n in N. Based on an earlier made convolution model of Egghe interpreted and reworked now for discrete scores we are able to produce theoretical fractional frequency distributions with only one parameter which are in very close agreement with the practical ones as found in a large dataset produced earlier by Rao 1995). The article also shows that irregular fractional frequency distributions are a consequence of Lotka's law and are not examples of breakdowns of this famous historical law,"['dual Lotka laws', 'convolution model', 'discrete scores', 'irregular fractional frequency distributions', 'citation analysis']",158,5
296,317,Relevance of Web documents ghosts consensus method The dominant method currently used to improve the quality of Internet search systems is often called digital democracy. Such an approach implies the utilization of the majority opinion of Internet users to determine the most relevant documents for example citation index usage for sorting of search results google.com or an enrichment of a query with terms that are asked frequently in relation with the query's theme. Digital democracy is an effective instrument in many cases but it has an unavoidable shortcoming which is a matter of principle the average intellectual and cultural level of Internet users is very low everyone knows what kind of information is dominant in Internet query statistics. Therefore when one searches the Internet by means of digital democracy systems one gets answers that reflect an underlying assumption that the user's mind potential is very low and that his cultural interests are not demanding. Thus it is more correct to use the term digital ochlocracy to refer to Internet search systems with digital democracy. Based on the well-known mathematical mechanism of linear programming we propose a method to solve the indicated problem,"['Internet search systems', 'digital democracy', 'majority opinion', 'citation index usage', 'search results', 'Internet query statistics', 'digital ochlocracy', 'linear programming', 'ghosts consensus method', 'World Wide Web', 'Internet', 'linear programming', 'relevance feedback', 'search engines']",192,14

298,319,Designing a screening experiment for highly reliable products Within a reasonable life-testing time how to improve the reliability of highly reliable products is one of the great challenges. By using a resolution III experiment together with degradation test Tseng et al. 1995 presented a case study of improving the reliability of fluorescent lamps. However in conducting such an experiment they did not address the problem of how to choose the optimal settings of variables such as sample size inspection frequency and termination time for each run which are influential to the correct identification of significant factors and the experimental cost. Assuming that the product's degradation paths satisfy Wiener processes this paper proposes a systematic approach to the aforementioned problem. First an identification rule is proposed. Next under the constraints of a minimum probability of correct decision and a maximum probability of incorrect decision of the proposed identification rule the optimum test plan can be obtained by minimizing the total experimental cost. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed method,"['screening experiment', 'highly reliable products', 'resolution III design', 'degradation tests', 'Wiener process', 'inspection frequency', 'termination time', 'optimal test plan', 'fluorescent lamps', 'minimum probability of correct decision', 'maximum probability of incorrect decision', 'identification rule', 'design of experiments', 'inspection', 'optimisation', 'probability', 'reliability', 'stochastic processes']",170,18
299,320,Warranty reserves for nonstationary sales processes Estimation of warranty costs in the event of product failure within the warranty period is of importance to the manufacturer. Costs associated with replacement or repair of the product are usually drawn from a warranty reserve fund created by the manufacturer. Considering a stochastic sales process first and second moments and thereby the variance are derived for the manufacturer's total discounted warranty cost of a single sale for single-component items under four different warranty policies from a manufacturer's point of view. These servicing strategies represent a renewable free-replacement nonrenewable free-replacement renewable pro-rata and a nonrenewable minimal-repair warranty plans. The results are extended to determine the mean and variance of total discounted warranty costs for the total sales over the life cycle of the product. Furthermore using a normal approximation warranty reserves necessary for a certain protection level so that reserves are not completely depleted are found. Results and their managerial implications are studied through an extensive example,"['nonstationary sales processes', 'warranty reserves', 'warranty costs estimation', 'product failure', 'product replacement', 'product repair', 'stochastic sales process', 'first moments', 'second moments', 'variance', 'total discounted warranty cost', 'single-component items', 'servicing strategies', 'renewable free-replacement', 'nonrenewable free-replacement', 'renewable pro-rata', 'nonrenewable minimal-repair warranty plans', 'total discounted warranty costs', 'product life cycle', 'normal approximation', 'managerial implications', 'life cycle costing', 'probability', 'retailing']",163,24

Heretofore experimenters wishing to create server-side experiments have had to write programs to create common gateway interface CGI scripts in programming languages such as Perl and C++. NetCloak uses simple HTML-like commands to create CGIs. We used NetCloak to implement an experiment on probability estimation. Measurements of time on task and participants IP addresses assisted quality control. Without prior training in less than 1 month we were able to use NetCloak to design and create a Web-based experiment and to help graduate students create three Web-based experiments of their own,"['NetCloak', 'server-side Web-based experiments', 'CGI programs', 'Web server', 'random assignment', 'Java', 'client-side applications', 'common gateway interface scripts', 'Perl', 'C++ language', 'HTML', 'probability estimation', 'IP addresses', 'quality control', 'graduate students', 'Internet', 'behavioral data', 'psychology', 'educational computing', 'hypermedia markup languages', 'information resources', 'Internet', 'probability', 'psychology']",127,24
304,325,Open courseware and shared knowledge in higher education Most college and university campuses in the United States and much of the developed world today maintain one two or several learning management systems LMSs which are courseware products that provide students and faculty with Web-based tools to manage course-related applications. Since the mid-1990s two predominant models of Web courseware management systems have emerged commercial and noncommercial. Some of the commercial products available today were created in academia as noncommercial but have since become commercially encumbered. Other products remain noncommercial but are struggling to survive in a world of fierce commercial competition. This article argues for an ethics of pedagogy in higher education that would be based on the guiding assumptions of the non-proprietary peer-to-peer open-source software movement,"['open courseware', 'shared knowledge', 'higher education', 'learning management systems', 'college', 'university', 'Web courseware management systems', 'commercial products', 'ethics', 'Internet', 'open-source software', 'courseware', 'information resources', 'Internet', 'public domain software']",126,15
305,326,Web-based experiments controlled by JavaScript an example from probability learning JavaScript programs can be used to control Web experiments. This technique is illustrated by an experiment that tested the effects of advice on performance in the classic probability-learning paradigm. Previous research reported that people tested via the Web or in the lab tended to match the probabilities of their responses to the probabilities that those responses would be reinforced. The optimal strategy however is to consistently choose the more frequent event probability matching produces suboptimal performance. We investigated manipulations we reasoned should improve performance. A horse race scenario in which participants predicted the winner in each of a series of races between two horses was compared with an abstract scenario used previously. Ten groups of learners received different amounts of advice including all combinations of 1 explicit instructions concerning the optimal strategy 2 explicit instructions concerning a monetary sum to maximize and 3 accurate information concerning the probabilities of events. The results showed minimal effects of horse race versus abstract scenario. Both advice concerning the optimal strategy and probability information contributed significantly to performance in the task. This paper includes a brief tutorial on JavaScript explaining with simple examples how to assemble a browser-based experiment,"['Web-based experiments', 'JavaScript', 'probability learning', 'advice', 'explicit instructions', 'probability', 'browser-based experiment', 'Internet-based research', 'authoring languages', 'educational computing', 'information resources', 'Internet', 'Java', 'probability']",205,14
306,327,Using latent semantic analysis to assess reader strategies We tested a computer-based procedure for assessing reader strategies that was based on verbal protocols that utilized latent semantic analysis LSA). Students were given self-explanation-reading training SERT which teaches strategies that facilitate self-explanation during reading such as elaboration based on world knowledge and bridging between text sentences. During a computerized version of SERT practice students read texts and typed self-explanations into a computer after each sentence. The use of SERT strategies during this practice was assessed by determining the extent to which students used the information in the current sentence versus the prior text or world knowledge in their self-explanations. This assessment was made on the basis of human judgments and LSA. Both human judgments and LSA were remarkably similar and indicated that students who were not complying with SERT tended to paraphrase the text sentences whereas students who were compliant with SERT tended to explain the sentences in terms of what they knew about the world and of information provided in the prior text context. The similarity between human judgments and LSA indicates that LSA will be useful in accounting for reading strategies in a Web-based version of SERT,"['latent semantic analysis', 'reader strategy assessment', 'computer-based procedure', 'verbal protocols', 'self-explanation-reading training', 'elaboration', 'world knowledge', 'text sentence bridging', 'human judgments', 'computer aided instruction', 'psychology']",198,11
307,328,Personality research on the Internet a comparison of Web-based and traditional instruments in take-home and in-class settings Students faculty and researchers have become increasingly comfortable with the Internet and many of them are interested in using the Web to collect data. Few published studies have investigated the differences between Web-based data and data collected with more traditional methods. In order to investigate these potential differences two important factors were crossed in this study whether the data were collected on line or not and whether the data were collected in a group setting at a fixed time or individually at a time of the respondent's choosing. The Visions of Morality scale Shelton and McAdams 1990 was used and the participants were assigned to one of four conditions in-class Web survey in-class paper-and-pencil survey take-home Web survey and take-home paper-and-pencil survey. No significant differences in scores were found for any condition however response rates were affected by the type of survey administered with the take-home Web-based instrument having the lowest response rate. Therefore researchers need to be aware that different modes of administration may affect subject attrition and may therefore confound investigations of other independent variables,"['personality research', 'Internet', 'Web-based instruments', 'data collection', 'Visions of Morality scale', 'in-class Web survey', 'in-class paper-and-pencil survey', 'take-home Web survey', 'take-home paper-and-pencil survey', 'response rates', 'administration', 'subject attrition', 'computer aided instruction', 'Internet', 'psychology']",194,15

Although most of this information is at least intended to be accurate there is much that is rumor innuendo urban legend and outright falsehood. This raises problems especially for students of all ages trying to do research or learn about some topic.

309,330,Improving computer security for authentication of users influence of proactive password restrictions Entering a user name-password combination is a widely used procedure for identification and authentication in computer systems. However it is a notoriously weak method in that the passwords adopted by many users are easy to crack. In an attempt to improve security proactive password checking may be used in which passwords must meet several criteria to be more resistant to cracking. In two experiments we examined the influence of proactive password restrictions on the time that it took to generate an acceptable password and to use it subsequently to log in. The required length was a minimum of five characters in experiment I and eight characters in experiment 2. In both experiments one condition had only the length restriction and the other had additional restrictions. The additional restrictions greatly increased the time it took to generate the password but had only a small effect on the time it took to use it subsequently to log in. For the five-character passwords 75 were cracked when no other restrictions were imposed and this was reduced to 33 with the additional restrictions. For the eight-character passwords 17 were cracked with no other restrictions and 12.5 with restrictions. The results indicate that increasing the minimum character length reduces crackability and increases security regardless of whether additional restrictions are imposed,"['computer security', 'user authentication', 'proactive password checking', 'proactive password restrictions', 'length restriction', 'five-character passwords', 'eight-character passwords', 'authorisation', 'message authentication']",227,9

312,333,Teaching psychology as a laboratory science in the age of the Internet For over 30 years psychologists have relied on computers to teach experimental psychology. With the advent of experiment generators students can create well-designed experiments and can test sophisticated hypotheses from the start of their undergraduate training. Characteristics of new Net-based experiment generators are discussed and compared with traditional stand-alone generators. A call is made to formally evaluate the instructional effectiveness of the wide range of experiment generators now available. Specifically software should be evaluated in terms of known learning outcomes using appropriate control groups. The many inherent differences between any two software programs should be made clear. The teacher's instructional method should be fully described and held constant between comparisons.

316,339,An automated parallel image registration technique based on the correlation of wavelet features With the increasing importance of multiple multiplatform remote sensing missions fast and automatic integration of digital data from disparate sources has become critical to the success of these endeavors. Our work utilizes maxima of wavelet coefficients to form the basic features of a correlation-based automatic registration algorithm. Our wavelet-based registration algorithm is tested successfully with data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer AVHRR and the Landsat Thematic Mapper TM which differ by translation and/or rotation. By the choice of high-frequency wavelet features this method is similar to an edge-based correlation method but by exploiting the multiresolution nature of a wavelet decomposition our method achieves higher computational speeds for comparable accuracies.

323,346,Baseball optimization and the World Wide Web The competition for baseball play-off spots-the fabled pennant race-is one of the most closely watched American sports traditions. While play-off race statistics such as games back and magic number are informative they are overly conservative and do not account for the remaining schedule of games. Using optimization techniques one can model schedule effects explicitly and determine precisely when a team has secured a play-off spot or has been eliminated from contention. The RIOT Baseball Play-off Races Web site developed at the University of California Berkeley provides automatic updates of new optimization-based play-off race statistics each day of the major league baseball season. In developing the site we found that we could determine the first-place elimination status of all teams in a division using a single linear-programming formulation since a minimum win threshold for teams finishing in first place applies to all teams in a division. We identified a similar but weaker result for the problem of play-off elimination with wildcard teams,"['baseball play-off spot competition', 'optimization', 'World Wide Web', 'pennant race', 'play-off race statistics', 'games back', 'magic number', 'game schedule', 'RIOT Baseball Play-off Races Web site', 'linear programming', 'LP', 'minimum win threshold', 'administrative data processing', 'information resources', 'Internet', 'linear programming', 'sport']",168,17

326,349,A self-adjusting quality of service control scheme We propose and analyze a self-adjusting Quality of Service QoS control scheme with the goal of optimizing the system reward as a result of servicing different priority clients with varying workload QoS and reward/penalty requirements. Our scheme is based on resource partitioning and designated degrade QoS areas such that system resources are partitioned into priority areas each of which is reserved specifically to serve only clients in a corresponding class with no QoS degradation plus one degraded QoS area into which all clients can be admitted with QoS adjustment being applied only to the lowest priority clients. We show that the best partition is dictated by the workload and the reward/penalty characteristics of clients in difference priority classes. The analysis results can be used by a QoS manager to optimize the system total reward dynamically in response to changing workloads at run time. We demonstrate the validity of our scheme by means of simulation and comparing the proposed QoS self-adjusting scheme with those that do not use resource partitioning or designated degraded QoS areas,"['self-adjusting quality of service control scheme', 'priority clients', 'resource partitioning', 'simulation', 'multimedia systems', 'performance evaluation', 'resource reservation', 'multimedia systems', 'quality of service']",181,9
327,350,There is no optimal routing policy for the torus A routing policy is the method used to select a specific output channel for a message from among a number of acceptable output channels. An optimal routing policy is a policy that maximizes the probability of a message reaching its destination without delays. Optimal routing policies have been proposed for several regular networks including the mesh and the hypercube. An open problem in interconnection network research has been the identification of an optimal routing policy for the torus. In this paper we show that there is no optimal routing policy for the torus. Our result is demonstrated by presenting a detailed example in which the best choice of output channel is dependent on the probability of each channel being available. This result settles in the negative a conjecture by J. Wu 1996 concerning an optimal routing policy for the torus,"['optimal routing policy', 'torus', 'hypercube', 'hypercube networks', 'network routing']",149,5

329,352,An efficient retrieval selection algorithm for video servers with random duplicated assignment storage technique Random duplicated assignment RDA is an approach in which video data is stored by assigning a number of copies of each data block to different randomly chosen disks. It has been shown that this approach results in smaller response times and lower disk and RAM costs compared to the well-known disk stripping techniques. Based on this storage approach one has to determine for each given batch of data blocks from which disk each of the data blocks is to be retrieved. This is to be done in such a way that the maximum load of the disks is minimized. The problem is called the retrieval selection problem RSP). In this paper we propose a new efficient algorithm for RSP. This algorithm is based on the breadth-first search approach and is able to guarantee optimal solutions for RSP in O(n/sup 2/+mn where m and n correspond to the number of data blocks and the number of disks respectively. We show that our proposed algorithm has a lower time complexity than an existing algorithm called the MFS algorithm,"['efficient retrieval selection algorithm', 'video servers', 'random duplicated assignment storage technique', 'copies', 'data block', 'randomly chosen disks', 'response times', 'RAM costs', 'disk costs', 'maximum load', 'breadth-first search', 'optimal solutions', 'time complexity', 'computational complexity', 'magnetic disc storage', 'random-access storage', 'resource allocation', 'storage allocation', 'tree searching', 'video on demand', 'video servers']",190,21

338,361,A pretopological approach for structural analysis The aim of this paper is to present a methodological approach for problems encountered in structural analysis. This approach is based upon the pretopological concepts of pseudoclosure and minimal closed subsets. The advantage of this approach is that it provides a framework which is general enough to model and formulate different types of connections that exist between the elements of a population. In addition it has enabled us to develop a new structural analysis algorithm. An explanation of the definitions and properties of the pretopological concepts applied in this work is first shown and illustrated in sample settings.

339,362,On batch-constructing B/sup +/-trees algorithm and its performance evaluation Efficient construction of indexes is very important in bulk-loading a database or adding a new index to an existing database since both of them should handle an enormous volume of data. In this paper we propose an algorithm for batch-constructing the B/sup +/-tree the most widely used index structure in database systems. The main characteristic of our algorithm is to simultaneously process all the key values to be placed on each B+-tree page when accessing the page. This avoids the overhead due to accessing the same page multiple times which results from applying the B+-tree insertion algorithm repeatedly. For performance evaluation we have analyzed our algorithm in terms of the number of disk accesses. The results show that the number of disk accesses excluding those in the relocation process is identical to the number of pages belonging to the B/sup +/-tree. Considering that the relocation process is an unavoidable preprocessing step for batch-constructing of B/sup +/-trees our algorithm requires just one disk access per B+-tree page and therefore turns out to be optimal. We also present the performance tendency in relation with different parameter values via simulation.

340,363,Synthetic simultaneity  natural and artificial In control loops each element introduces time delays. If those time delays are larger than the critical times for control of the system a problem exists. I show a simple approach to mitigating this problem by basing the controller's decisions not on the observations themselves but on our projections as to what the observations will be at the time our controls reach the controlled system. Finally I argue that synthetic simultaneity explains Libet's 1993 results better than Libet's explanation,"['control loops', 'time delays', 'critical times', 'controller decisions', 'observations', 'synthetic simultaneity', 'control systems', 'control theory', 'delays', 'planning (artificial intelligence)', 'software agents']",84,11
341,364,MACLP multi agent constraint logic programming Multi agent systems MAS have become the key technology for decomposing complex problems in order to solve them more efficiently or for problems distributed in nature. However many industrial applications besides their distributed nature also involve a large number of parameters and constraints i.e. they are combinatorial. Solving such particularly hard problems efficiently requires programming tools that combine MAS technology with a programming schema that facilitates the modeling and solution of constraints. This paper presents MACLP multi agent constraint logic programming a logic programming platform for building in a declarative way multi agent systems with constraint-solving capabilities. MACLP extends CSPCONS a logic programming system that permits distributed program execution through communicating sequential Prolog processes with constraints by providing all the necessary facilities for communication between agents. These facilities abstract from the programmer all the low-level details of the communication and allow him to focus on the development of the agent itself,"['multi agent constraint logic programming', 'multi agent systems', 'parameters', 'combinatorial problems', 'hard problems', 'constraint solving', 'distributed program execution', 'communicating sequential Prolog processes', 'constraint handling', 'distributed programming', 'multi-agent systems', 'PROLOG']",157,12
342,365,Self-organizing feature maps predicting sea levels In this paper a new method for predicting sea levels employing self-organizing feature maps is introduced. For that purpose the maps are transformed from an unsupervised learning procedure to a supervised one. Two concepts originally developed to solve the problems of convergence of other network types are proposed to be applied to Kohonen networks a functional relationship between the number of neurons and the number of learning examples and a criterion to break off learning. The latter one can be shown to be conform with the process of self-organization by using U-matrices for visualization of the learning procedure. The predictions made using these neural models are compared for accuracy with observations and with the prognoses prepared using six models two hydrodynamic models a statistical model a nearest neighbor model the persistence model and the verbal forecasts that are broadcast and kept on record by the Sea Level Forecast Service of the Federal Maritime and Hydrography Agency BSH in Hamburg. Before training the maps the meteorological and oceanographic situation has to be condensed as well as possible and the weight and learning vectors have to be made as small as possible. The self-organizing feature maps predict sea levels better than all six models of comparison,"['self-organizing feature maps', 'sea level prediction', 'supervised learning', 'Kohonen networks', 'neurons', 'U-matrices', 'visualization', 'hydrodynamic models', 'statistical model', 'nearest neighbor model', 'persistence model', 'verbal forecasts', 'Sea Level Forecast Service', 'Federal Maritime and Hydrography Agency', 'oceanographic situation', 'meteorological situation', 'learning vectors', 'geophysics computing', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'oceanography', 'self-organising feature maps']",210,21

344,367,A study on meaning processing of dialogue with an example of development of travel consultation system This paper describes an approach to processing meaning instead of processing information in computing. Human intellectual activity is supported by linguistic activities in the brain. Therefore processing the meaning of language instead of processing information should allow us to realize human intelligence on a computer. As an example of the proposed framework for processing meaning we build a travel consultation dialogue system which can understand utterance by a user and retrieve information through dialogue. Through a simulation example of the system we show that both information processing and language processing are integrated,"['meaning processing', 'human intellectual activity', 'linguistic activities', 'travel consultation dialogue system', 'user utterance understanding', 'information retrieval', 'information processing', 'language processing', 'computational linguistics', 'information retrieval', 'natural language interfaces', 'speech-based user interfaces', 'travel industry']",108,13
345,368,From a biological to a computational model for the autonomous behavior of an animat Endowing an autonomous system like a robot with intelligent behavior is difficult for several reasons. First behavior is such a wide topic that a general framework paradigm of inspiration must be chosen in order to obtain a consistent model. Such a framework can be for example biological modeling or an artificial intelligence approach. Second a general framework is not sufficient to determine a fully specified program to be implemented in a robot. Many choices tuning and tests must be carried out before obtaining a robust system. A biological model is presented based on the definition of cortex-like automata representing elementary functions in the perceptive motor or associative domain. These automata are connected in a network whose architecture functioning and learning rules are described in a cortical framework. Second the computational model derived from that biological model is specified. The way units exchange and compute variables through links is explained with reference to corresponding biological elements. It is then easier to report experiments allowing an autonomous system to learn regularities of a simple environment and to exploit them to satisfy some internal drives. Even if additional biological hints can be added this model allow us to better understand how a biological model can be implemented and how biological properties can emerge from a distributed set of units,"['autonomous system', 'robot', 'autonomous behavior', 'intelligent behavior', 'animat', 'tuning', 'tests', 'robust system', 'biological model', 'cortex-like automata', 'elementary functions', 'perceptive domain', 'associative domain', 'motor domain', 'learning rules', 'architecture', 'computational model', 'variable computation', 'variable exchange', 'links', 'regularity learning', 'simple environment', 'internal drives', 'artificial life', 'automata theory', 'learning (artificial intelligence)']",230,26

347,370,Virtual borders real laws Internet activity and treaties National governments are working to tame activity on the Internet. They have worked steadily to extend control over online activities that they believe affect their interests even when the activities occur outside their borders. These usually involve what governments regard as their domain protecting public order enforcing commercial laws and occasionally protecting consumer interests. Methods have included assertions or legal jurisdiction based on where material is accessible instead of where it originates and the blocking of sites service providers or entire high level domains from access by citizens. Such instances are mentioned in this article. Whilst larger companies are able to defend themselves against overseas lawsuits individuals and smaller organizations lack the resources to defend what are often normal business activities at home but could violate the laws of local jurisdictions in countries around the world. The problems of libel are discussed as are the blocking of certain sites by certain countries.

348,371,A better ballot box Election officials are examining technologies to address a wide range of voting issues. The problems observed in the November 2000 US election accelerated existing trends to get rid of lever machines punch-cards and hand-counted paper ballots and replace them with mark-sense balloting Internet and automatic teller machine ATM kiosk style computer-based systems. An estimated US 2-$4 billion will be spent in the United States and Canada to update voting systems during the next decade. Voting online might enable citizens to vote even if they are unable to get to the polls. Yet making these methods work right turns out to be considerably more difficult than originally thought. New electronic voting systems pose risks as well as solutions. As it turns out many of the voting products currently for sale provide less accountability poorer reliability and greater opportunity for widespread fraud than those already in use.

351,375,Separation and tracking of multiple broadband sources with one electromagnetic vector sensor A structure for adaptively separating enhancing and tracking uncorrelated sources with an electromagnetic vector sensor EMVS is presented. The structure consists of a set of parallel spatial processors one for each individual source. Two stages of processing are involved in each spatial processor. The first preprocessing stage rejects all other sources except the one of interest while the second stage is an adaptive one for maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio SNR and tracking the desired source. The preprocessings are designed using the latest source parameter estimates obtained from the source trackers and a redesign is activated periodically or whenever any source has been detected by the source trackers to have made significant movement. Compared with conventional adaptive beamforming the algorithm has the advantage that no a priori information on any desired signal location is needed the sources are separated at maximum SNR and their locations are available. The structure is also well suited for parallel implementation.

First the structure and operating principle of the PMLSM are described in detail. Second a field-oriented control PMLSM servo drive is introduced. Then each segment of the multisegment switching surfaces is designed to match the corresponding part of the trapezoidal velocity profile thus the motor dynamics on the specified-segment switching surface have the desired velocity or acceleration corresponding part of the trapezoidal velocity profile.

355,379,Feedforward maximum power point tracking of PV systems using fuzzy controller A feedforward maximum power MP point tracking scheme is developed for the interleaved dual boost IDB converter fed photovoltaic PV system using fuzzy controller. The tracking algorithm changes the duty ratio of the converter such that the solar cell array SCA voltage equals the voltage corresponding to the MP point at that solar insolation. This is done by the feedforward loop which generates an error signal by comparing the instantaneous array voltage and reference voltage. The reference voltage for the feedforward loop corresponding to the MP point is obtained by an off-line trained neural network. Experimental data is used for off-line training of the neural network which employs back-propagation algorithm. The proposed fuzzy feedforward peak power tracking effectiveness is demonstrated through the simulation and experimental results and compared with the conventional proportional plus integral PI controller based system.

356,380,Quantitative speed control for SRM drive using fuzzy adapted inverse model Quantitative and robust speed control for a switched reluctance motor SRM drive is considered to be rather difficult and challenging owing to its highly nonlinear dynamic behavior. A speed control scheme having two-degree-of-freedom 2DOF structure is developed here to improve the speed dynamic response of an SRM drive. In the proposed control scheme the feedback controller is quantitatively designed to meet the desired regulation control requirements first. Then a reference model and a command feedforward controller based on an inverse plant model are employed to yield the desired tracking response at nominal case. As the variations of system parameters and operating conditions occur the prescribed control specifications may not be satisfied any more. To improve this the inverse model is adaptively tuned by a fuzzy control scheme so that the model-following tracking error is significantly reduced. In addition a simple disturbance cancellation robust controller is added to improve the tracking and regulation control performances further,"['quantitative speed control', 'SRM drive', 'fuzzy adapted inverse model', 'switched reluctance motor', 'nonlinear dynamic behavior', 'two-degree-of-freedom structure', 'speed dynamic response', 'regulation control requirements', 'reference model', 'command feedforward controller', 'inverse plant model', 'tracking response', 'system parameters', 'operating conditions', 'control specifications', 'fuzzy control scheme', 'model-following tracking error', 'disturbance cancellation controller', 'feedforward', 'fuzzy control', 'model reference adaptive control systems', 'reluctance motor drives', 'velocity control']",166,23

358,382,Robust wavelet neuro control for linear brushless motors Design simulation and experimental implementation of a wavelet basis function network learning controller for linear brushless dc motors LBDCM are considered. Stability robustness with position tracking is the primary concern. The proposed controller deals mainly with external disturbances e.g. nonlinear friction force and payload variation in motion control of linear motors. It consists of two parts one is a state feedback component and the other one is a learning feedback component. The state feedback controller is designed on the basis of a simple linear model and the learning feedback component is a wavelet neural controller. The attenuation effect of wavelet neural networks on friction force is first verified by the numerical method. The learning effect of wavelet neural networks on friction force is also shown in the numerical results. Then a wavelet neural network is applied on a real LBDCM to on-line suppress the friction force which may be variable due to the different lubrication.

359,383,Outlier resistant adaptive matched filtering Robust adaptive matched filtering AMF whereby outlier data vectors are censored from the covariance matrix estimate is considered in a maximum likelihood estimation MLE setting. It is known that outlier data vectors whose steering vector is highly correlated with the desired steering vector can significantly degrade the performance of AMF algorithms such as sample matrix inversion SMI or fast maximum likelihood FML). Four new algorithms that censor outliers are presented which are derived via approximation to the MLE solution. Two algorithms each are related to using the SMI or the FML to estimate the unknown underlying covariance matrix. Results are presented using computer simulations which demonstrate the relative effectiveness of the four algorithms versus each other and also versus the SMI and FML algorithms in the presence of outliers and no outliers.

Criteria for efficient organization of the on-board database are discussed with reference to a brightness-independent initial acquisition algorithm. Star catalog generation preprocessing is described with emphasis on the identification of minimum star brightness for detection by a sensor based on a charge coupled device CCD photodetector. This is a crucial step for proper evaluation of the attainable sky coverage when selecting the stars to be included in the on-board catalog. Test results are also reported both for reliability and accuracy even if the former is considered to be the primary target.

361,385,Multiple model adaptive estimation with filter spawning Multiple model adaptive estimation MMAE with filter spawning is used to detect and estimate partial actuator failures on the VISTA F-16. The truth model is a full six-degree-of-freedom simulation provided by Calspan and General Dynamics. The design models are chosen as 13-state linearized models including first order actuator models. Actuator failures are incorporated into the truth model and design model assuming a failure to free stream. Filter spawning is used to include additional filters with partial actuator failure hypotheses into the MMAE bank. The spawned filters are based on varying degrees of partial failures in terms of effectiveness associated with the complete-actuaton-failure hypothesis with the highest conditional probability of correctness at the current time. Thus a blended estimate of the failure effectiveness is found using the filters estimates based upon a no-failure hypothesis a complete actuator failure hypothesis and the spawned filters partial-failure hypotheses. This yields substantial precision in effectiveness estimation compared with what is possible without spawning additional filters making partial failure adaptation a viable methodology,"['multiple model adaptive estimation', 'filter spawning', 'partial actuator failures', 'VISTA F-16', 'truth model', 'six-degree-of-freedom simulation', 'Calspan', 'in-flight simulator', 'test aircraft', 'flight control systems', 'General Dynamics', 'linearized models', 'MMAE', 'partial failures', 'conditional probability', 'no-failure hypothesis', 'actuators', 'adaptive estimation', 'aerospace simulation', 'aircraft control', 'military aircraft', 'probability']",174,22
362,386,Matched-filter template generation via spatial filtering application to fetal biomagnetic recordings We have developed a two-step procedure for signal processing of fetal biomagnetic recordings that removes cardiac interference and noise. First a modified matched filter MF is applied to remove maternal cardiac interference then a simple signal space projection SSP is applied to remove noise. The key difference between our MF and a conventional one is that the interference template and the template scaling are derived from a signal that has been spatially filtered to isolate the interference rather than from the raw signal. Unlike conventional MFs ours is able to separate maternal and fetal cardiac complexes even when they have similar morphology and overlap strongly. When followed by a SSP that preserves only the signal subspace the noise is reduced to a low level,"['maternal cardiac interference removal', 'simple signal space projection', 'noise removal', 'signal subspace preservation', 'fetal magnetocardiography', 'spatial filtering', 'interference template', 'raw signal', 'template scaling', 'modified matched filter', 'maternal cardiac interference', 'interference (signal)', 'magnetocardiography', 'matched filters', 'medical signal processing', 'obstetrics', 'spatial filters']",135,17

364,388,Noninvasive myocardial activation time imaging a novel inverse algorithm applied to clinical ECG mapping data Linear approaches like the minimum-norm least-square algorithm show insufficient performance when it comes to estimating the activation time map on the surface of the heart from electrocardiographic ECG mapping data. Additional regularization has to be considered leading to a nonlinear problem formulation. The Gauss-Newton approach is one of the standard mathematical tools capable of solving this kind of problem. To our experience this algorithm has specific drawbacks which are caused by the applied regularization procedure. In particular under clinical conditions the amount of regularization cannot be determined clearly. For this reason we have developed an iterative algorithm solving this nonlinear problem by a sequence of regularized linear problems. At each step of iteration an individual L-curve is computed. Subsequent iteration steps are performed with the individual optimal regularization parameter. This novel approach is compared with the standard Gauss-Newton approach. Both methods are applied to simulated ECG mapping data as well as to single beat sinus rhythm data from two patients recorded in the catheter laboratory. The proposed approach shows excellent numerical and computational performance even under clinical conditions at which the Gauss-Newton approach begins to break down,"['noninvasive myocardial activation time imaging', 'electrodiagnostics', 'activation time imaging', 'L-curve method', 'noninvasive electrocardiography', 'tikhonov regularization', 'Gauss-Newton approach', 'individual optimal regularization parameter', 'catheter laboratory', 'clinical conditions', 'iteration steps', 'heart surface', 'regularization procedure', 'inverse algorithm', 'clinical ECG mapping data', 'electrocardiography', 'inverse problems', 'iterative methods', 'medical image processing', 'muscle']",202,20

366,390,Automated breath detection on long-duration signals using feedforward backpropagation artificial neural networks A new breath-detection algorithm is presented intended to automate the analysis of respiratory data acquired during sleep. The algorithm is based on two independent artificial neural networks ANN/sub insp and ANN/sub expi that recognize in the original signal windows of interest where the onset of inspiration and expiration occurs. Postprocessing consists in finding inside each of these windows of interest minimum and maximum corresponding to each inspiration and expiration. The ANN/sub insp and ANN/sub expi correctly determine respectively 98.0 and 98.7 of the desired windows when compared with 29 820 inspirations and 29 819 expirations detected by a human expert obtained from three entire-night recordings. Postprocessing allowed determination of inspiration and expiration onsets with a mean difference with respect to the same human expert of mean +or SD 34 +or 71 ms for inspiration and 5 +or 46 ms for expiration. The method proved to be effective in detecting the onset of inspiration and expiration in full night continuous recordings. A comparison of five human experts performing the same classification task yielded that the automated algorithm was undifferentiable from these human experts failing within the distribution of human expert results. Besides being applicable to adult respiratory volume data the presented algorithm was also successfully applied to infant sleep data consisting of uncalibrated rib cage and abdominal movement recordings. A comparison with two previously published algorithms for breath detection in respiratory volume signal shows that the presented algorithm has a higher specificity while presenting similar or higher positive predictive values,"['respiratory movements', 'automated breath detection', 'postprocessing', 'inspiration', 'expiration', 'automated algorithm', 'human experts', 'entire-night recordings', 'uncalibrated rib cage', 'abdominal movement recordings', 'infant sleep data', 'adult respiratory volume data', 'long-duration signals', 'feedforward backpropagation artificial neural networks', '34 ms', '5 ms', 'backpropagation', 'feedforward neural nets', 'medical signal detection', 'pneumodynamics', 'sleep']",261,21
367,391,Model selection in electromagnetic source analysis with an application to VEFs In electromagnetic source analysis it is necessary to determine how many sources are required to describe the electroencephalogram or magnetoencephalogram adequately. Model selection procedures MSPs or goodness of fit procedures give an estimate of the required number of sources. Existing and new MSPs are evaluated in different source and noise settings two sources which are close or distant and noise which is uncorrelated or correlated. The commonly used MSP residual variance is seen to be ineffective that is it often selects too many sources. Alternatives like the adjusted Hotelling's test Bayes information criterion and the Wald test on source amplitudes are seen to be effective. The adjusted Hotelling's test is recommended if a conservative approach is taken and MSPs such as Bayes information criterion or the Wald test on source amplitudes are recommended if a more liberal approach is desirable.

Time-frequency analyses of normotensive and hypertensive blood flow data obtained from either the whole kidney or the single-nephron show that indeed both the myogenic and tubuloglomerular feedback TGF mechanisms have time-varying characteristics. Furthermore we utilized the Renyi entropy to measure the complexity of blood-flow dynamics in the time-frequency plane in an effort to discern differences between normotensive and hypertensive recordings. We found a clear difference in Renyi entropy between normotensive and hypertensive blood flow recordings at the whole kidney level for both forced p  0.037 and spontaneous arterial pressure fluctuations p  0.033 and at the single-nephron level p  0.008). Especially at the single-nephron level the mean Renyi entropy is significantly larger for hypertensive than normotensive rats suggesting more complex dynamics in the hypertensive condition. To further evaluate whether or not the separation of dynamics between normotensive and hypertensive rats is found in the prescribed frequency ranges of the myogenic and TGF mechanisms we employed multiresolution wavelet transform. Our analysis revealed that exclusively over scale ranges corresponding to the frequency intervals of the myogenic and TGF mechanisms the widths of the blood flow wavelet coefficients fall into disjoint sets for normotensive and hypertensive rats. The separation of the scales at the myogenic and TGF frequency ranges is distinct and obtained with 100 accuracy. However this observation remains valid only for the whole kidney blood pressure/flow data. The results suggest that understanding of the time-varying properties of the two mechanisms is required for a complete description of renal autoregulation,"['time-varying properties', 'Sprague-Dawley rats', 'Wistar rats', 'Long-Evans rats', 'whole kidney', 'single-nephron', 'Renyi entropy', 'spontaneous arterial pressure fluctuations', 'hypertensive rats', 'normotensive rats', 'renal autoregulatory mechanisms', 'broad-band forced arterial blood pressure fluctuations', 'single-nephron renal blood flow', 'spontaneous oscillations', 'biocontrol', 'blood flow measurement', 'entropy', 'kidney', 'medical signal processing', 'time-frequency analysis', 'wavelet transforms']",301,21
369,393,The use of the SPSA method in ECG analysis The classification monitoring and compression of electrocardiogram ECG signals recorded of a single patient over a relatively long period of time is considered. The particular application we have in mind is high-resolution ECG analysis such as late potential analysis morphology changes in QRS during arrythmias T-wave alternants or the study of drug effects on ventricular activation. We propose to apply a modification of a classical method of cluster analysis or vector quantization. The novelty of our approach is that we use a new distortion measure to quantify the distance of two ECG cycles and the class-distortion measure is defined using a min-max criterion. The new class-distortion-measure is much more sensitive to outliers than the usual distortion measures using average-distance. The price of this practical advantage is that computational complexity is significantly increased. The resulting nonsmooth optimization problem is solved by an adapted version of the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation SPSA method of J. Spall IEEE Trans. Automat. Contr. vol. 37 p. 332-41 Mar. 1992). The main idea is to generate a smooth approximation by a randomization procedure. The viability of the method is demonstrated on both simulated and real data.

370,394,Model intestinal microflora in computer simulation a simulation and modeling package for host-microflora interactions The ecology of the human intestinal microflora and its interaction with the host are poorly understood. Though more and more data are being acquired in part using modern molecular methods development of a quantitative theory has not kept pace with this increase in observing power. This is in part due to the complexity of the system and to the lack of simulation environments in which to test what the ecological effect of a hypothetical mechanism of interaction would be before resorting to laboratory experiments. The MIMICS project attempts to address this through the development of a cellular automaton for simulation of the intestinal microflora.

372,396,Convolution-based global simulation technique for millimeter-wave photodetector and photomixer circuits A fast convolution-based time-domain approach to global photonic-circuit simulation is presented that incorporates a physical device model in the complete detector or mixer circuit. The device used in the demonstration of this technique is a GaAs metal-semiconductor-metal MSM photodetector that offers a high response speed for the detection and generation of millimeter waves. Global simulation greatly increases the accuracy in evaluating the complete circuit performance because it accounts for the effects of the millimeter-wave embedding circuit. Device and circuit performance are assessed by calculating optical responsivity and bandwidth.

373,397,Accurate modeling of lossy nonuniform transmission lines by using differential quadrature methods This paper discusses an efficient numerical approximation technique called the differential quadrature method DQM which has been adapted to model lossy uniform and nonuniform transmission lines. The DQM can quickly compute the derivative of a function at any point within its bounded domain by estimating a weighted linear sum of values of the function at a small set of points belonging to the domain. Using the DQM the frequency-domain Telegrapher's partial differential equations for transmission lines can be discretized into a set of easily solvable algebraic equations. DQM reduces interconnects into multiport models whose port voltages and currents are related by rational formulas in the frequency domain. Although the rationalization process in DQM is comparable with the Pade approximation of asymptotic waveform evaluation AWE applied to transmission lines the derivation mechanisms in these two disparate methods are significantly different. Unlike AWE which employs a complex moment-matching process to obtain rational approximation the DQM requires no approximation of transcendental functions thereby avoiding the process of moment generation and moment matching. Due to global sampling of points in the DQM approximation it requires far fewer grid points in order to build accurate discrete models than other numerical methods do. The DQM-based time-domain model can be readily integrated in a circuit simulator like SPICE,"['lossy nonuniform transmission lines', 'differential quadrature method', 'numerical approximation technique', 'frequency-domain Telegrapher PDE', 'partial differential equations', 'algebraic equations', 'interconnects', 'multiport models', 'multiconductor transmission lines', 'rationalization process', 'time-domain model', 'circuit simulation', 'integrated circuit interconnections', 'matrix algebra', 'time-domain analysis', 'transient analysis', 'transmission line theory']",223,17
374,398,An unconditionally stable extended USE finite-element time-domain solution of active nonlinear microwave circuits using perfectly matched layers This paper proposes an extension of the unconditionally stable finite-element time-domain FETD method for the global electromagnetic analysis of active microwave circuits. This formulation has two advantages. First the time-step size is no longer governed by the spatial discretization of the mesh but rather by the Nyquist sampling criterion. Second the implementation of the truncation by the perfectly matched layers PML is straightforward. An anisotropic PML absorbing material is presented for the truncation of FETD lattices. Reflection less than 50 dB is obtained numerically over the entire propagation bandwidth in waveguide and microstrip line.

375,399,Low-voltage DRAM sensing scheme with offset-cancellation sense amplifier A novel bitline sensing scheme is proposed for low-voltage DRAM to achieve low power dissipation and compatibility with low-voltage CMOS. One of the major obstacles in low-voltage DRAM is the degradation of data-retention time due to low signal level at the memory cell which requires power-consuming refresh operations more frequently. This paper proposes an offset-cancellation sense-amplifier scheme OCSA that improves data-retention time significantly even at low supply voltage. It also improves die efficiency because the proposed scheme reduces the number of sense amplifiers by supporting more cells in each sense amplifier. Measurements show that the data-retention time of the proposed scheme at 1.5-V supply voltage is 2.4 times of the conventional scheme at 2.0 V,"['LV DRAM sensing scheme', 'low-voltage sensing scheme', 'offset-cancellation sense amplifier scheme', 'bitline sensing scheme', 'low power dissipation', 'low-voltage CMOS compatibility', 'data-retention time', 'memory cell', 'differential amplifier configuration', 'power-consuming refresh operations', 'sensing margin', '1.5 V', 'CMOS memory circuits', 'differential amplifiers', 'DRAM chips', 'low-power electronics']",123,16

384,408,.NET obfuscation and intellectual property The author considers obfuscation options for protecting .NET code. Many programs won't need obfuscation because the loss caused by reverse engineering will be nonexistent. Numerous obfuscators are already available for the .NET platform ranging from a basic renaming obfuscator to a fully functional obfuscator that handles mixed IL/native code assemblies created in any managed language including Microsoft's C++ with Managed Extensions. An obfuscator simply makes your application harder to reverse engineer. It does not prevent reverse engineering.

391,539,Perfusion quantification using Gaussian process deconvolution The quantification of perfusion using dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI DSC-MRI requires deconvolution to obtain the residual impulse response function IRF). In this work a method using the Gaussian process for deconvolution GPD is proposed. The fact that the IRF is smooth is incorporated as a constraint in the method. The GPD method which automatically estimates the noise level in each voxel has the advantage that model parameters are optimized automatically. The GPD is compared to singular value decomposition SVD using a common threshold for the singular values and to SVD using a threshold optimized according to the noise level in each voxel. The comparison is carried out using artificial data as well as data from healthy volunteers. It is shown that GPD is comparable to SVD with a variable optimized threshold when determining the maximum of the IRF which is directly related to the perfusion. GPD provides a better estimate of the entire IRF. As the signal-to-noise ratio SNR increases or the time resolution of the measurements increases GPD is shown to be superior to SVD. This is also found for large distribution volumes,"['perfusion quantification', 'Gaussian process deconvolution', 'dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI', 'residual impulse response function', 'optimized model parameters', 'singular value decomposition', 'noise level', 'capillary blood flow', 'mean transit time', 'optimized joint Gaussian distribution', 'correlation length', 'likelihood function', 'biomedical MRI', 'deconvolution', 'Gaussian distribution', 'haemodynamics', 'haemorheology', 'medical image processing', 'singular value decomposition']",190,19

Ventilation and perfusion images were simultaneously acquired using the flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery FAIR method as volunteers alternately inhaled room air and 100 oxygen. Images of the T/sub 1 distribution were calculated for five volunteers for both selective T/sub 1f and nonselective T/sub 1 inversion. The average T/sub 1 was 1360 ms+or-116 ms and the average T/sub 1f was 1012 ms+or-112 ms yielding a difference that is statistically significant P<0.002). Excluding large pulmonary vessels the average V/Q SI ratios were 0.355+or-0.073 for the left lung and 0.371+or-0.093 for the right lung which are in agreement with the theoretical V/Q SI ratio. Plots of the WO SI ratio are similar to the logarithmic normal distribution obtained by multiple inert gas elimination techniques with a range of ratios matching ventilation and perfusion.

The female binge eating disorder BED patients n=20 involved in a residential weight control treatment including low-calorie diet 1200 cal/day and physical training were randomly assigned either to the multidimensional VR treatment or to psychonutritional groups based on the cognitive-behavior approach. Patients were administered a battery of outcome measures assessing eating disorders symptomathology attitudes toward food body dissatisfaction level of anxiety motivation for change level of assertiveness and general psychiatric symptoms. In the short term the VR treatment was more effective than the traditional cognitive-behavioral psychonutritional groups in improving the overall psychological state of the patients. In particular the therapy was more effective in improving body satisfaction self-efficacy and motivation for change. No significant differences were found in the reduction of the binge eating behavior. The possibility of inducing a significant change in body image and its associated behaviors using a VR-based short-term therapy can be useful to improve the body satisfaction in traditional weight reduction programs.

In addition self-report questionnaires subjective ratings of anxiety SUDs and behavioral observations included here as flying behavior before beginning treatment and at a three-month posttreatment followup were included. In the analysis of results the Chi-square test of behavioral observations based on a three-month posttreatment followup revealed a statistically significant difference in flying behavior between the groups  chi sup 2/(4)=19.41 p<0.001]. Only one participant 10 who received IET eight of the ten participants 80 who received VRGETno and ten out of the ten participants 100 who received VRGETpm reported an ability to fly without medication or alcohol at three-month followup. Although this study included small sample sizes for the three groups the results showed VRGET was more effective than IET in the treatment of flying. It also suggests that physiological feedback may add to the efficacy of VR treatment,"['flying fear', 'virtual reality graded exposure therapy', 'imaginal exposure therapy', 'phobia', 'physiological feedback', 'physiology', 'questionnaires', 'subjective ratings of anxiety', 'behavioral observations', 'Chi-square test', 'patient treatment', 'medical computing', 'patient treatment', 'psychology', 'user interfaces', 'virtual reality']",255,16
395,543,The development of virtual reality therapy VRT system for the treatment of acrophobia and therapeutic case Virtual reality therapy VRT based on this sophisticated technology has been used in the treatment of subjects diagnosed with acrophobia a disorder that is characterized by marked anxiety upon exposure to heights and avoidance of heights. Conventional VR systems for the treatment of acrophobia have limitations over-costly devices or somewhat unrealistic graphic scenes. The goal of this study was to develop an inexpensive and more realistic virtual environment VE in which to perform exposure therapy for acrophobia. It is based on a personal computer and a virtual scene of a bunge-jump tower in the middle of a large city. The virtual scenario includes an open lift surrounded by props beside a tower which allows the patient to feel a sense of heights. The effectiveness of the VE was evaluated through the clinical treatment of a subject who was suffering from the fear of heights. As a result it was proved that this VR environment was effective and realistic at overcoming acrophobia according not only to the comparison results of a variety of questionnaires before and after treatment but also to the subject's comments that the VE seemed to evoke more fearful feelings than the real situation,"['virtual reality therapy system', 'acrophobia treatment', 'therapeutic case', 'patient anxiety', 'patient treatment', 'realistic virtual environment', 'exposure therapy', 'personal computer', 'virtual scene', 'clinical treatment', 'psychotherapy', 'heights phobia', 'medical computing', 'patient treatment', 'psychology', 'user interfaces', 'virtual reality']",212,17
396,544,Virtual reality treatment of flying phobia Flying phobia FP might become a very incapacitating and disturbing problem in a person's social working and private areas. Psychological interventions based on exposure therapy have proved to be effective but given the particular nature of this disorder they bear important limitations. Exposure therapy for FP might be excessively costly in terms of time money and efforts. Virtual reality VR overcomes these difficulties as different significant environments might be created where the patient can interact with what he or she fears while in a totally safe and protected environment the therapist's consulting room. This paper intends on one hand to show the different scenarios designed by our team for the VR treatment of FP and on the other to present the first results supporting the effectiveness of this new tool for the treatment of FP in a multiple baseline study,"['medical virtual reality', 'psychology', 'flying phobia', 'patient treatment', 'psychological interventions', 'anxiety disorders', 'virtual exposure', 'exposure therapy', 'medical computing', 'patient treatment', 'psychology', 'user interfaces', 'virtual reality']",146,13
397,545,Interaction and presence in the clinical relationship virtual reality VR as communicative medium between patient and therapist The great potential offered by virtual reality VR to clinical psychologists derives prevalently from the central role in psychotherapy occupied by the imagination and by memory. These two elements which are fundamental in our life present absolute and relative limits to the individual potential. Using VR as an advanced imaginal system an experience that is able to reduce the gap existing between imagination and reality it is possible to transcend these limits. In this sense VR can improve the efficacy of a psychological therapy for its capability of reducing the distinction between the computer's reality and the conventional reality. Two are the core characteristics of this synthetic imaginal experience the perceptual illusion of nonmediation and the possibility of building and sharing a common ground. In this sense experiencing presence in a clinical virtual environment VE such as a shared virtual hospital requires more than reproduction of the physical features of external reality. It requires the creation and sharing of the cultural web that makes meaningful and therefore visible both people and objects populating the environment. The paper outlines a framework for supporting the development and tuning of clinically oriented VR systems,"['virtual reality', 'patient-therapist communication', 'clinical psychology', 'psychotherapy', 'imagination', 'memory', 'presence', 'psychological therapy', 'clinical virtual environment', 'shared virtual hospital', 'medical computing', 'patient treatment', 'psychology', 'user interfaces', 'virtual reality']",208,15
398,546,Real-time quasi-2-D inversion of array resistivity logging data using neural network We present a quasi-2-D real-time inversion algorithm for a modern galvanic array tool via dimensional reduction and neural network simulation. Using reciprocity and superposition we apply a numerical focusing technique to the unfocused data. The numerically focused data are much less subject to 2-D and layering effects and can be approximated as from a cylindrical 1-D Earth. We then perform 1-D inversion on the focused data to provide approximate information about the 2-D resistivity structure. A neural network is used to perform forward modeling in the 1-D inversion which is several hundred times faster than conventional numerical forward solutions. Testing our inversion algorithm on both synthetic and field data shows that this fast inversion algorithm is useful for providing formation resistivity information at a well site,"['real-time quasi-2-D inversion', 'array resistivity logging data', 'neural network', 'real-time inversion algorithm', 'galvanic array tool', 'dimensional reduction', 'reciprocity', 'superposition', 'numerical focusing technique', 'unfocused data', '1-D inversion', 'focused data', 'forward modeling', 'formation resistivity', 'well site', 'array signal processing', 'Earth crust', 'geophysical prospecting', 'geophysical signal processing', 'inverse problems', 'neural nets', 'terrestrial electricity']",137,22

403,551,Access privilege management in protection systems We consider the problem of managing access privileges on protected objects. We associate one or more locks with each object one lock for each access right defined by the object type. Possession of an access right on a given object is certified by possession of a key for this object if this key matches one of the object locks. We introduce a number of variants to this basic key-lock technique. Polymorphic access rights make it possible to decrease the number of keys required to certify possession of complex access privileges that are defined in terms of several access rights. Multiple locks on the same access right allow us to exercise forms of selective revocation of access privileges. A lock conversion function can be used to reduce the number of locks associated with any given object to a single lock. The extent of the results obtained is evaluated in relation to alternative methodologies for access privilege management,"['access privilege management', 'protection systems', 'protected objects', 'locks', 'key-lock technique', 'polymorphic access rights', 'complex access privilege possession certification', 'selective revocation', 'lock conversion function', 'authorisation']",162,10

405,553,Application of traditional system design techniques to Web site design After several decades of computer program construction there emerged a set of principles that provided guidance to produce more manageable programs. With the emergence of the plethora of Internet web sites one wonders if similar guidelines are followed in their construction. Since this is a new technology no apparent universally accepted methods have emerged to guide the designer in Web site construction. This paper reviews the traditional principles of structured programming and the preferred characteristics of Web sites. Finally a mapping of how the traditional guidelines may be applied to Web site construction is presented. The application of the traditional principles of structured programming to the design of a Web site can provide a more usable site for the visitors to the site.

406,554,A scalable and lightweight QoS monitoring technique combining passive and active approaches on the mathematical formulation of CoMPACT monitor To make a scalable and lightweight QoS monitoring system we 2002 have proposed a new QoS monitoring technique called the change-of-measure based passive/active monitoring CoMPACT Monitor which is based on the change-of-measure framework and is an active measurement transformed by using passively monitored data. This technique enables us to measure detailed QoS information for individual users applications and organizations in a scalable and lightweight manner. In this paper we present the mathematical foundation of CoMPACT Monitor. In addition we show its characteristics through simulations in terms of typical implementation issues for inferring the delay distributions. The results show that CoMPACT Monitor gives accurate QoS estimations with only a small amount of extra traffic for active measurement,"['quality of service', 'change-of-measure', 'passive monitoring', 'active monitoring', 'CoMPACT Monitor', 'delay distributions', 'Internet', 'QoS monitoring', 'network performance', 'Internet', 'monitoring', 'quality of service', 'telecommunication traffic']",135,13
407,555,Computing transient gating charge movement of voltage-dependent ion channels The opening of voltage-gated sodium potassium and calcium ion channels has a steep relationship with voltage. In response to changes in the transmembrane voltage structural movements of an ion channel that precede channel opening generate a capacitative gating current. The net gating charge displacement due to membrane depolarization is an index of the voltage sensitivity of the ion channel activation process. Understanding the molecular basis of voltage-dependent gating of ion channels requires the measurement and computation of the gating charge Q. We derive a simple and accurate semianalytic approach to computing the voltage dependence of transient gating charge movement Q-V relationship of discrete Markov state models of ion channels using matrix methods. This approach allows rapid computation of Q-V curves for finite and infinite length step depolarizations and is consistent with experimentally measured transient gating charge. This computational approach was applied to Shaker potassium channel gating including the impact of inactivating particles on potassium channel gating currents,"['transient gating charge movement', 'transmembrane voltage', 'gating current', 'action potentials', 'ion channels', 'charge movement', 'inactivation', 'immobilization', 'Markov state model', 'bioelectric potentials', 'Markov processes', 'neural nets']",166,12
408,556,Coarse-grained reduction and analysis of a network model of cortical response I. Drifting grating stimuli We present a reduction of a large-scale network model of visual cortex developed by McLaughlin Shapley Shelley and Wielaard. The reduction is from many integrate-and-fire neurons to a spatially coarse-grained system for firing rates of neuronal subpopulations. It accounts explicitly for spatially varying architecture ordered cortical maps such as orientation preference that vary regularly across the cortical layer and disordered cortical maps such as spatial phase preference or stochastic input conductances that may vary widely from cortical neuron to cortical neuron. The result of the reduction is a set of nonlinear spatiotemporal integral equations for phase-averaged firing rates of neuronal subpopulations across the model cortex derived asymptotically from the full model without the addition of any extra phenomological constants. This reduced system is used to study the response of the model to drifting grating stimuli  where it is shown to be useful for numerical investigations that reproduce at far less computational cost the salient features of the point-neuron network and for analytical investigations that unveil cortical mechanisms behind the responses observed in the simulations of the large-scale computational model. For example the reduced equations clearly show 1 phase averaging as the source of the time-invariance of cortico-cortical conductances 2 the mechanisms in the model for higher firing rates and better orientation selectivity of simple cells which are near pinwheel centers 3 the effects of the length-scales of cortico-cortical coupling and 4 the role of noise in improving the contrast invariance of orientation selectivity,"['large-scale network model', 'visual cortex', 'neuronal networks', 'coarse-graining', 'point-neuron network', 'phase-averaged firing rates', 'nonlinear spatiotemporal integral equations', 'dynamics', 'orientation selectivity', 'brain models', 'neural nets']",258,11

A generalized version of the integrate-and-fire model is presented that qualitatively reproduces firing rates and membrane trajectories of motoneurons. The description is based on the spike-response model and includes three different time constants the passive membrane time constant a recovery time of the input conductance after each spike and a time constant of the spike afterpotential. The effect of stochastic background input on the peristimulus time histogram PSTH response to spike input is calculated analytically. Model results are compared with the experimental data of Poliakov et al. 1996). The linearized theory shows that the PSTH response to an input spike is proportional to a filtered version of the postsynaptic potential generated by the input spike. The shape of the filter depends on the background activity.

416,564,Development of a computer-aided manufacturing system for profiled edge lamination tooling Profiled edge lamination PEL tooling is a promising rapid tooling RT method involving the assembly of an array of laminations whose top edges are simultaneously profiled and beveled based on a CAD model of the intended tool surface. To facilitate adoption of this RT method by industry a comprehensive PEL tooling development system is proposed. The two main parts of this system are 1 iterative tool design based on thermal and structural models and 2 fabrication of the tool using a computer-aided manufacturing CAM software and abrasive water jet cutting. CAM software has been developed to take lamination slice data profiles from any proprietary RP software in the form of polylines and create smooth kinematically desirable cutting trajectories for each tool lamination. Two cutting trajectory algorithms called identical equidistant profile segmentation and adaptively vector profiles projection AVPP were created for this purpose.

417,565,Control of thin film growth in chemical vapor deposition manufacturing systems a feasibility study A study is carried out to design and optimize chemical vapor deposition CVD systems for material fabrication. Design and optimization of the CVD process is necessary to satisfying strong global demand and ever increasing quality requirements for thin film production. Advantages of computer aided optimization include high design turnaround time flexibility to explore a larger design space and the development and adaptation of automation techniques for design and optimization. A CVD reactor consisting of a vertical impinging jet at atmospheric pressure for growing titanium nitride films is studied for thin film deposition. Numerical modeling and simulation are used to determine the rate of deposition and film uniformity over a wide range of design variables and operating conditions. These results are used for system design and optimization. The optimization procedure employs an objective function characterizing film quality productivity and operational costs based on reactor gas flow rate susceptor temperature and precursor concentration.

418,566,Sensing and control of double-sided arc welding process The welding industry is driven to improve productivity without sacrificing quality. For thick material welding the current practice is to use backing or multiple passes. The laser welding process capable of achieving deep narrow penetration can significantly improve welding productivity for such applications by reducing the number of passes. However its competitiveness in comparison with traditional arc welding is weakened by its high cost strict fit-up requirement and difficulty in welding large structures. In this work a different method referred to as double-sided arc welding DSAW is developed to improve the arc concentration for arc welding. A sensing and control system is developed to achieve deep narrow penetration under variations in welding conditions. Experiments verified that the pulsed keyhole DSAW system developed is capable of achieving deep narrow penetration on a 1/2 inch thick square butt joint in a single pass,"['double-sided arc welding', 'laser welding process', 'control system', 'process control', 'thick material welding', 'energy density', 'controlled pulse keyhole', 'arc welding', 'control systems', 'process control']",149,10

420,568,Modeling cutting temperatures for turning inserts with various tool geometries and materials Temperatures are of interest in machining because cutting tools often fail by thermal softening or temperature-activated wear. Many models for cutting temperatures have been developed but these models consider only simple tool geometries such as a rectangular slab with a sharp corner. This report describes a finite element study of tool temperatures in cutting that accounts for tool nose radius and included angle effects. A temperature correction factor model that can be used in the design and selection of inserts is developed to account for these effects. A parametric mesh generator is used to generate the finite element models of tool and inserts of varying geometries. The steady-state temperature response is calculated using NASTRAN solver. Several finite element analysis FEA runs are performed to quantify the effects of inserts included angle nose radius and materials for the insert and the tool holder on the cutting temperature at the insert rake face. The FEA results are then utilized to develop a temperature correction factor model that accounts for these effects. The temperature correction factor model is integrated with an analytical temperature model for rectangular inserts to predict cutting temperatures for contour turning with inserts of various shapes and nose radii. Finally experimental measurements of cutting temperature using the tool-work thermocouple technique are performed and compared with the predictions of the new temperature model. The comparisons show good agreement,"['cutting temperature model', 'turning inserts', 'machining', 'tool nose radius', 'parametric mesh generator', 'finite element models', 'temperature correction factor', 'insert shape effects', 'tool geometries', 'cutting', 'machine tools', 'machining', 'mesh generation', 'temperature distribution']",239,14
421,569,Application of an internally consistent material model to determine the effect of tool edge geometry in orthogonal machining It is well known that the edge geometry of a cutting tool affects the forces measured in metal cutting. Two experimental methods have been suggested in the past to extract the ploughing non-cutting component from the total measured force 1 the extrapolation approach and 2 the dwell force technique. This study reports the behavior of zinc during orthogonal machining using tools of controlled edge radius. Applications of both the extrapolation and dwell approaches show that neither produces an analysis that yields a material response consistent with the known behavior of zinc. Further analysis shows that the edge geometry modifies the shear zone of the material and thereby modifies the forces. When analyzed this way the measured force data yield the expected material response without requiring recourse to an additional ploughing component,"['tool edge geometry', 'cutting tool', 'metal cutting', 'ploughing component', 'extrapolation', 'dwell force', 'zinc', 'edge geometry', 'orthogonal machining', 'cutting', 'extrapolation', 'machine tools', 'machining']",149,13

Rapidly approaching now is the trend for next-generation CMMs. However the increases in measuring velocity of CMM applications are limited by dynamic errors that occur in CMMs. In this paper a systematic approach for modeling the dynamic errors of a touch-trigger probe CMM is developed through theoretical analysis and experimental study. An overall analysis of the dynamic errors of CMMs is conducted with weak components of the CMM identified by a laser interferometer. The probing process as conducted with a touch-trigger probe is analyzed. The dynamic errors are measured modeled and predicted using neural networks.

The device can be easily incorporated into a conventional tensile test machine and material resistance to buckling is measured as the buckling height versus the in-plane strain state. The design yields different but consistent buckling modes with easy changes of boundary conditions either clamped or freed and sample geometry. Experimental results are then used to verify a hybrid approach to buckling prediction i.e. the combination of the FEM analysis and an energy-based analytical wrinkling criterion.

425,573,ECG-gated sup 18/F-FDG positron emission tomography. Single test evaluation of segmental metabolism function and contractile reserve in patients with coronary artery disease and regional dysfunction sup 18/F-fluorodeoxyglucose sup 18/F-FDG)-positron emission tomography PET provides information about myocardial glucose metabolism to diagnose myocardial viability. Additional information about the functional status is necessary. Comparison of tomographic metabolic PET with data from other imaging techniques is always hampered by some transfer uncertainty and scatter. We wanted to evaluate a new Fourier-based ECG-gated PET technique using a high resolution scanner providing both metabolic and functional data with respect to feasibility in patients with diseased left ventricles. Forty-five patients with coronary artery disease and at least one left ventricular segment with severe hypokinesis or akinesis at biplane cineventriculography were included. A new Fourier-based ECG-gated metabolic sup 18/F-FDG-PET was performed in these patients. Function at rest and sup 18/F-FDG uptake were examined in the PET study using a 36-segment model. Segmental comparison with ventriculography revealed a high reliability in identifying dysfunctional segments 96%). sup 18/F-FDG uptake of normokinetic/hypokinetic/akinetic segments was 75.4+or-7.5 65.3+or-10.5 and 35.9+or-15.2 p<0.001). In segments or=70 sup 18/F-FDG uptake no akinesia was observed. No residual function was found below 40 sup 18/F-FDG uptake. An additional dobutamine test was performed and revealed inotropic reserve viability in 42 akinetic segments and 45 hypokinetic segments.

426,574,A novel approach for the detection of pathlines in X-ray angiograms the wavefront propagation algorithm Presents a new pathline approach based on the wavefront propagation principle and developed in order to reduce the variability in the outcomes of the quantitative coronary artery analysis. This novel approach called wavepath reduces the influence of the user-defined start and endpoints of the vessel segment and is therefore more robust and improves the reproducibility of the lesion quantification substantially. The validation study shows that the wavepath method is totally constant in the middle part of the pathline even when using the method for constructing a bifurcation or sidebranch pathline. Furthermore the number of corrections needed to guide the wavepath through the correct vessel is decreased from an average of 0.44 corrections per pathline to an average of 0.12 per pathline. Therefore it can be concluded that the wavepath algorithm improves the overall analysis substantially,"['wavefront propagation principle', 'quantitative coronary artery analysis', 'user-defined startpoints', 'user-defined endpoints', 'vessel segment', 'lesion quantification', 'wavepath method', 'bifurcation', 'sidebranch pathline', 'corrections', 'correct vessel', 'wavefront propagation algorithm', 'X-ray angiograms', 'algorithm theory', 'bifurcation', 'blood vessels', 'diagnostic radiography', 'medical image processing']",150,18

430,578,New approach to standing phase angle reduction for power system restoration During power system restoration it is necessary to check the phase angle between two buses before closing circuit breakers to connect a line between them. These angles may occur across a tie line between two systems or between two connected subsystems within a system. In case of large standing phase angle SPA difference the synchro-check relay does not allow closing of the breaker for this line. Therefore this excessive SPA has to be reduced before attempting to connect the line. In this paper a new and fast method for reducing SPA is presented. For this purpose the standing phase angle difference between two specific buses is represented in terms of sensitivity factors associated with the change in active power generations and consumption at the buses. Then the proposed method reschedule generation of selected units or shed load of selected buses to reduce excessive SPA difference between two buses based on sensitivity factors,"['power system restoration', 'standing phase angle reduction approach', 'circuit breaker closing', 'synchrocheck relay', 'power line connection', 'sensitivity factors', 'circuit breakers', 'control system analysis computing', 'control system synthesis', 'load shedding', 'power system analysis computing', 'power system control', 'power system restoration']",163,13

It proposes two procedures for this symmetrization the application of the traditional expressions assuming symmetry conditions and the use of optimization methods based on the general analytical equations. Specifically the paper applies and evaluates these methods to analyze the Steinmetz system design.

432,580,A genetic approach to the optimization of automatic generation control parameters for power systems This paper presents a method based on genetic algorithm for the automatic generation control of power systems. The technique is applied to control a system which includes two areas tied together through a power line. As a consequence of continuous load variation the frequency of the power system changes with time. In conventional studies frequency transients are minimized by using integral controllers and thus zero steady-state error is obtained. In this paper integral controller gains and frequency bias factors are determined by using the genetic algorithm.

436,584,Hybrid fuzzy modeling of chemical processes Fuzzy models have been proved to have the ability of modeling all plants without any priori information. However the performance of conventional fuzzy models can be very poor in the case of insufficient training data due to their poor extrapolation capacity. In order to overcome this problem a hybrid grey-box fuzzy modeling approach is proposed in this paper to combine expert experience local linear models and historical data into a uniform framework. It consists of two layers. The expert fuzzy model constructed from linguistic information the local linear model and the T-S type fuzzy model constructed from data are all put in the first layer. Layer 2 is a fuzzy decision module that is used to decide which model in the first layer should be employed to make the final prediction. The output of the second layer is the output of the hybrid fuzzy model. With the help of the linguistic information the poor extrapolation capacity problem caused by sparse training data for conventional fuzzy models can be overcome. Simulation result for pH neutralization process demonstrates its modeling ability over the linear models the expert fuzzy model and the conventional fuzzy model,"['fuzzy modeling', 'chemical processes', 'expert fuzzy model', 'fuzzy decision module', 'process modeling', 'chemical engineering computing', 'fuzzy set theory', 'modelling', 'process control']",198,9
437,585,Fuzzy system modeling in pharmacology an improved algorithm In this paper we propose an improved fuzzy system modeling algorithm to address some of the limitations of the existing approaches identified during our modeling with pharmacological data. This algorithm differs from the existing ones in its approach to the cluster validity problem i.e. number of clusters the projection schema i.e. input membership assignment and rule determination and significant input determination. The new algorithm is compared with the Bazoon-Turksen model which is based on the well-known Sugeno-Yasukawa approach. The comparison was made in terms of predictive performance using two different data sets. The first comparison was with a two variable nonlinear function prediction problem and the second comparison was with a clinical pharmacokinetic modeling problem. It is shown that the proposed algorithm provides more precise predictions. Determining the degree of significance for each input variable allows the user to distinguish their relative importance,"['fuzzy system modeling', 'pharmacology', 'cluster validity problem', 'projection schema', 'significant input determination', 'predictive performance', 'fuzzy sets', 'fuzzy logic', 'pharmacokinetic modeling', 'fuzzy logic', 'medicine', 'modelling']",151,12
438,586,A strategy for a payoff-switching differential game based on fuzzy reasoning In this paper a new concept of a payoff-switching differential game is introduced. In this new game any one player at any time may have several choices of payoffs for the future. Moreover the payoff-switching process including the time of payoff switching and the outcome payoff of any one player is unknown to the other. Indeed the overall payoff which is a sequence of several payoffs is unknown until the game ends. An algorithm for determining a reasoning strategy based on fuzzy reasoning is proposed. In this algorithm the fuzzy theory is used to estimate the behavior of one player during a past time interval. By deriving two fuzzy matrices GSM game similarity matrix and VGSM variation of GSM the behavior of the player can be quantified. Two weighting vectors are selected to weight the relative importance of the player's behavior at each past time instant. Finally a simple fuzzy inference rule is adopted to generate a linear reasoning strategy. The advantage of this algorithm is that it provides a flexible way for differential game specialists to convert their knowledge into a reasonable strategy. A practical example of guarding three territories is given to illustrate our main ideas,"['payoff-switching differential game', 'payoff switching', 'outcome payoff', 'reasoning strategy', 'fuzzy reasoning', 'fuzzy matrices', 'game similarity matrix', 'weighting vectors', 'fuzzy inference', 'differential game', 'differential games', 'fuzzy logic', 'inference mechanisms']",209,13
439,587,An improved self-organizing CPN-based fuzzy system with adaptive back-propagation algorithm This paper describes an improved self-organizing CPN-based Counter-Propagation Network fuzzy system. Two self-organizing algorithms IUSOCPN and ISSOCPN being unsupervised and supervised respectively are introduced. The idea is to construct the neural-fuzzy system with a two-phase hybrid learning algorithm which utilizes a CPN-based nearest-neighbor clustering scheme for both structure learning and initial parameters setting and a gradient descent method with adaptive learning rate for fine tuning the parameters. The obtained network can be used in the same way as a CPN to model and control dynamic systems while it has a faster learning speed than the original back-propagation algorithm. The comparative results on the examples suggest that the method is fairly efficient in terms of simple structure fast learning speed and relatively high modeling accuracy,"['self-organizing fuzzy system', 'Counter-Propagation Network', 'neural-fuzzy system', 'hybrid learning', 'gradient descent', 'structure learning', 'initial parameters setting', 'back-propagation learning scheme', 'backpropagation', 'fuzzy neural nets', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'self-adjusting systems']",134,12
440,588,An accurate COG defuzzifier design using Lamarckian co-adaptation of learning and evolution This paper proposes a design technique of optimal center of gravity COG defuzzifier using the Lamarckian co-adaptation of learning and evolution. The proposed COG defuzzifier is specified by various design parameters such as the centers widths and modifiers of MFs. The design parameters are adjusted with the Lamarckian co-adaptation of learning and evolution where the learning performs a local search of design parameters in an individual COG defuzzifier but the evolution performs a global search of design parameters among a population of various COG defuzzifiers. This co-adaptation scheme allows to evolve much faster than the non-learning case and gives a higher possibility of finding an optimal solution due to its wider searching capability. An application to the truck backer-upper control problem of the proposed co-adaptive design method of COG defuzzifier is presented. The approximation ability and control performance are compared with those of the conventionally simplified COG defuzzifier in terms of the fuzzy logic controller's approximation error and the average tracing distance respectively,"['optimal center of gravity defuzzifier', 'learning', 'evolution', 'fuzzy logic controller', 'local search', 'control system synthesis', 'fuzzy control', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'parameter estimation']",175,9

454,602,Image fusion between sup 18/FDG-PET and MRI/CT for radiotherapy planning of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal carcinomas Accurate diagnosis of tumor extent is important in three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. This study reports the use of image fusion between 18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography sup 18/FDG-PET and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography MRI/CT for better targets delineation in radiotherapy planning of head-and-neck cancers. The subjects consisted of 12 patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma and 9 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma NPC who were treated with radical radiotherapy between July 1999 and February 2001. Image fusion between sup 18/FDG-PET and MRI/CT was performed using an automatic multimodality image registration algorithm which used the brain as an internal reference for registration. Gross tumor volume GTV was determined based on clinical examination and sup 18/FDG uptake on the fusion images. Clinical target volume CTV was determined following the usual pattern of lymph node spread for each disease entity along with the clinical presentation of each patient. Except for 3 cases with superficial tumors all the other primary tumors were detected by sup 18/FDG-PET. The GTV volumes for primary tumors were not changed by image fusion in 19 cases 89 increased by 49 in one NPC and decreased by 45 in another NPC. Normal tissue sparing was more easily performed based on clearer GTV and CTV determination on the fusion images. In particular parotid sparing became possible in 15 patients 71 whose upper neck areas near the parotid glands were tumor-free by sup 18/FDG-PET. Within a mean follow-up period of 18 months no recurrence occurred in the areas defined as CTV which was treated prophylactically except for 1 patient who experienced nodal recurrence in the CTV and simultaneous primary site recurrence.

459,607,A building block approach to automated engineering Shenandoah Valley Electric Cooperative SVEC Mt. Crawford Virginia US recognized the need to automate engineering functions and create an interactive model of its distribution system in the early 1990s. It had used Milsoft's DA software for more than 10 years to make engineering studies and had a Landis and Gyr SCADA system and a hybrid load management system for controlling water heater switches. With the development of GIS and facilities management FM applications SVEC decided this should be the basis for an information system that would model its physical plant and interface with its accounting and billing systems. It could add applications such as outage management staking line design and metering to use this information and interface with these databases. However based on SVEC's size it was not feasible to implement a sophisticated and expensive GIS/FM system.

460,608,How closely can a personal computer clock track the UTC timescale via the Internet Nowadays many software packages allow you to keep the clock of your personal computer synchronized to time servers spread over the internet. We present how a didactic laboratory can evaluate in a statistical sense the minimum synch error of this process the other extreme the maximum is guaranteed by the code itself). The measurement set-up utilizes the global positioning system satellite constellation in common view between two similar timing stations one acts as a time server for the other so the final timing difference at the second station represents the total synch error through the internet. Data recorded over batches of 10000 samples show a typical RMS value of 35 ms. This measurement configuration allows students to obtain a much better understanding of the synch task and pushes them at all times to look for an experimental verification of data results even when they come from the most sophisticated black boxes now readily available off the shelf,"['personal computer clock', 'UTC timescale', 'internet', 'software packages', 'time servers', 'didactic laboratory', 'statistical sense', 'global positioning system satellite constellation', 'final timing difference', 'synch error', 'black boxes', 'clocks', 'computer aided instruction', 'Internet', 'teaching']",171,15

462,610,AGC for autonomous power system using combined intelligent techniques In the present work two intelligent load frequency controllers have been developed to regulate the power output and system frequency by controlling the speed of the generator with the help of fuel rack position control. The first controller is obtained using fuzzy logic FL only whereas the second one by using a combination of FL genetic algorithms and neural networks. The aim of the proposed controller(s is to restore in a very smooth way the frequency to its nominal value in the shortest time possible whenever there is any change in the load demand etc. The action of these controller(s provides a satisfactory balance between frequency overshoot and transient oscillations with zero steady-state error. The design and performance evaluation of the proposed controller(s structure are illustrated with the help of case studies applied without loss of generality to a typical single-area power system.

463,611,Intelligent optimal sieving method for FACTS device control in multi-machine systems A multi-target oriented optimal control strategy for FACTS devices installed in multi-machine power systems is presented in this paper which is named the intelligent optimal sieving control IOSC method. This new method divides the FACTS device output region into several parts and selects one typical value from each part which is called output candidate. Then an intelligent optimal sieve is constructed which predicts the impacts of each output candidate on a power system and sieves out an optimal output from all of the candidates. The artificial neural network technologies and fuzzy methods are applied to build the intelligent sieve. Finally the real control signal of FACTS devices is calculated according to the selected optimal output through inverse system method. Simulation has been done on a three-machine power system and the results show that the proposed IOSC controller can effectively attenuate system oscillations and enhance the power system transient stability,"['FACTS', 'intelligent control', 'intelligent optimal sieving method', 'FACTS device control', 'multi-machine systems', 'multi-target oriented optimal control strategy', 'intelligent optimal sieve', 'artificial neural network technologies', 'fuzzy methods', 'control signal', 'selected optimal output', 'inverse system method', 'three-machine power system', 'system oscillations attenuation', 'power system transient stability enhancement', 'control system synthesis', 'flexible AC transmission systems', 'fuzzy set theory', 'intelligent control', 'neural nets', 'optimal control', 'power system control', 'predictive control']",160,23

The adopted hybrid active filter consists of one active filter and one passive filter connected in series. By controlling the equivalent output voltage of active filter the harmonic currents generated by the nonlinear load are blocked and flowed into the passive filter. The power rating of the converter is reduced compared with the pure active filters to filter the harmonic currents. The harmonic current detecting approach and DC-link voltage regulation are proposed to obtain equivalent voltage of active filter.

475,623,Stochastic recurrences of Jackpot Keno We describe a mathematical model and simulation study for Jackpot Keno as implemented by Jupiters Network Gaming JNG in the Australian state of Queensland and as controlled by the Queensland Office of Gaming Regulation QOGR http://www.qogr.qld.gov.au/keno.shtml). The recurrences for the house net hold are derived and it is seen that these are piecewise linear with a ternary domain split and further the split points are stochastic in nature. Since this structure is intractable Brockett and Levine Statistics  Probability  their Applications CBS College Publishing 1984 estimation of house net hold obtained through an appropriately designed simulator using a random number generator with desirable properties is described. Since the model and simulation naturally derives hold given payscale but JNG and QOGR require payscale given hold an inverse problem was required to be solved. This required development of a special algorithm which may be described as a stochastic binary search. Experimental results are presented in which the simulator is used to determine jackpot pay-scales so as to satisfy legal requirements of approximately 75 of net revenue returned to the players i.e. 25 net hold for the house JNG).

476,624,A hybrid ML-EM algorithm for calculation of maximum likelihood estimates in semiparametric shared frailty models This paper describes a generalised hybrid ML-EM algorithm for the calculation of maximum likelihood estimates in semiparametric shared frailty models the Cox proportional hazard models with hazard functions multiplied by a parametric frailty random variable. This hybrid method is much faster than the standard EM method and faster than the standard direct maximum likelihood method ML Newton-Raphson for large samples. We have previously applied this method to semiparametric shared gamma frailty models and verified by simulations the asymptotic and small sample statistical properties of the frailty variance estimates. Let theta sub 0 be the true value of the frailty variance parameter. Then the asymptotic distribution is normal for theta sub 0/>0 while it is a 50-50 mixture between a point mass at zero and a normal random variable on the positive axis for theta sub 0/=0. For small samples simulations suggest that the frailty variance estimates are approximately distributed as an x-(100-x mixture 0<or=x<or=50 between a point mass at zero and a normal random variable on the positive axis even for theta sub 0/>0. We apply this method and verify by simulations these statistical results for semiparametric shared log-normal frailty models.

478,626,Approximate confidence intervals for one proportion and difference of two proportions Constructing a confidence interval for a binomial proportion or the difference of two proportions is a routine exercise in daily data analysis. The best-known method is the Wald interval based on the asymptotic normal approximation to the distribution of the observed sample proportion though it is known to have bad performance for small to medium sample sizes. Agresti et al. 1998 2000 proposed an Adding-4 method 4 pseudo-observations are added with 2 successes and 2 failures and then the resulting pseudo-)sample proportion is used. The method is simple and performs extremely well. Here we propose an approximate method based on a t-approximation that takes account of the uncertainty in estimating the variance of the observed pseudo-)sample proportion. It follows the same line of using a t-test rather than z-test in testing the mean of a normal distribution with an unknown variance. For some circumstances our proposed method has a higher coverage probability than the Adding-4 method,"['approximate confidence intervals', 'binomial proportion', 'difference of two proportions', 'data analysis', 't-approximation', 'uncertainty', 'variance estimation', 't-test', 'normal distribution', 'coverage probability', 'pseudo-sample proportion', 'approximation theory', 'binomial distribution', 'data analysis', 'normal distribution', 'sampling methods']",167,16

480,628,Rank tests of association for exchangeable paired data We describe two rank tests of association for paired exchangeable data motivated by the study of lifespans in twins. The pooled sample is ranked. The nonparametric test of association is based on R/sup + the sum of the smaller within-pair ranks. A second measure L/sup + is the sum of within-pair rank products. Under the null hypothesis of within-pair independence the two test statistics are approximately normally distributed. Expressions for the exact means and variances of R/sup + and L/sup + are given. We describe the power of these two statistics under a close alternative hypothesis to that of independence. Both the R/sup + and L/sup + tests indicate nonparametric statistical evidence of positive association of longevity in identical twins and a negligible relationship between the lifespans of fraternal twins listed in the Danish twin registry. The statistics are also applied to the analysis of a clinical trial studying the time to failure of ventilation tubes in children with bilateral otitis media,"['rank tests', 'association', 'paired exchangeable data', 'twin lifespans', 'pooled sample', 'nonparametric test', 'within-pair ranks', 'within-pair rank products', 'null hypothesis', 'within-pair independence', 'test statistics', 'exact means', 'exact variances', 'nonparametric statistical evidence', 'longevity', 'identical twins', 'fraternal twins', 'Danish twin registry', 'clinical trial', 'ventilation tube failure time', 'bilateral otitis media', 'data analysis', 'medical computing', 'paediatrics', 'statistical analysis']",170,25
481,629,Calibrated initials for an EM applied to recursive models of categorical variables The estimates from an EM when it is applied to a large causal model of 10 or more categorical variables are often subject to the initial values for the estimates. This phenomenon becomes more serious as the model structure becomes more complicated involving more variables. As a measure of compensation for this it has been recommended in literature that EMs are implemented several times with different sets of initial values to obtain more appropriate estimates. We propose an improved approach for initial values. The main idea is that we use initials that are calibrated to data. A simulation result strongly indicates that the calibrated initials give rise to the estimates that are far closer to the true values than the initials that are not calibrated,"['EM', 'recursive models', 'categorical variables', 'calibrated initials', 'large causal model', 'initial values', 'simulation', 'calibration', 'parameter estimation', 'probability', 'simulation']",137,11
482,630,Score tests for zero-inflated Poisson models In many situations count data have a large proportion of zeros and the zero-inflated Poisson regression ZIP model may be appropriate. A simple score test for zero-inflation comparing the ZIP model with a constant proportion of excess zeros to a standard Poisson regression model was given by van den Broek 1995). We extend this test to the more general situation where the zero probability is allowed to depend on covariates. The performance of this test is evaluated using a simulation study. To identify potentially important covariates in the zero-inflation model a composite test is proposed. The use of the general score test and the composite procedure is illustrated on two examples from the literature. The composite score test is found to suggest appropriate models,"['count data', 'score tests', 'zero-inflated Poisson regression model', 'zero probability', 'covariates', 'excess zeros', 'simulation', 'composite test', 'data analysis', 'statistical analysis', 'stochastic processes']",130,11

Sitter and Wu 1993 compared the delta and Fieller intervals for the median effective dose  mu sub 50 assuming a logistic dose-response curve. Their results indicated that although Fieller intervals are generally superior to delta intervals they appear to be conservative. Here an adjusted form of the Fieller interval for mu sub gamma  termed an adjusted Fieller AF interval is introduced.

484,632,Modelling dependencies in paired comparison data a log-linear approach In many Bradley-Terry models a more or less explicit assumption is that all decisions of the judges are independent. An assumption which might be questionable at least for the decisions of a given judge. In paired comparison studies a judge chooses among objects several times and in such cases judgements made by the same judge are likely to be dependent. A log-linear representation for the Bradley-Terry model is developed which takes into account dependencies between judgements. The modelling of the dependencies is embedded in the analysis of multiple binomial responses which has the advantage of interpretability in terms of conditional odds ratios. Furthermore the modelling is done in the framework of generalized linear models thus parameter estimation and the assessment of goodness of fit can be obtained in the standard way by using e.g. GLIM or another standard software,"['paired comparison data dependency modelling', 'log-linear approach', 'Bradley-Terry model', 'judge decisions', 'multiple binomial responses', 'conditional odds ratios', 'generalized linear models', 'parameter estimation', 'goodness of fit', 'GLIM', 'data analysis', 'decision theory', 'parameter estimation', 'probability', 'statistical analysis']",148,15

487,635,Detection and estimation of abrupt changes in the variability of a process Detection of change-points in normal means is a well-studied problem. The parallel problem of detecting changes in variance has had less attention. The form of the generalized likelihood ratio test statistic has long been known but its null distribution resisted exact analysis. In this paper we formulate the change-point problem for a sequence of chi-square random variables. We describe a procedure that is exact for the distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic for all even degrees of freedom and gives upper and lower bounds for odd and also for non-integer degrees of freedom. Both the liberal and conservative bounds for chi sub 1//sup 2 degrees of freedom are shown through simulation to be reasonably tight. The important problem of testing for change in the normal variance of individual observations corresponds to the chi sub 1//sup 2 case. The non-null case is also covered and confidence intervals for the true change point are derived. The methodology is illustrated with an application to quality control in a deep level gold mine.

488,636,FLID-DL congestion control for layered multicast We describe fair layered increase/decrease with dynamic layering FLID-DL a new multirate congestion control algorithm for layered multicast sessions. FLID-DL generalizes the receiver-driven layered congestion control protocol RLC introduced by Vicisano et al. Proc. IEEE INFOCOM San Francisco CA  p.996-1003 Mar. 1998)ameliorating the problems associated with large Internet group management protocol IGMP leave latencies and abrupt rate increases. Like RLC FLID-DL is a scalable receiver-driven congestion control mechanism in which receivers add layers at sender-initiated synchronization points and leave layers when they experience congestion. FLID-DL congestion control coexists with transmission control protocol TCP flows as well as other FLID-DL sessions and supports general rates on the different multicast layers. We demonstrate via simulations that our congestion control scheme exhibits better fairness properties and provides better throughput than previous methods. A key contribution that enables FLID-DL and may be useful elsewhere is dynamic layering DL which mitigates the negative impact of long IGMP leave latencies and eliminates the need for probe intervals present in RLC.

489,637,A digital fountain approach to asynchronous reliable multicast The proliferation of applications that must reliably distribute large rich content to a vast number of autonomous receivers motivates the design of new multicast and broadcast protocols. We describe an ideal fully scalable protocol for these applications that we call a digital fountain. A digital fountain allows any number of heterogeneous receivers to acquire content with optimal efficiency at times of their choosing. Moreover no feedback channels are needed to ensure reliable delivery even in the face of high loss rates.

490,638,Scalable secure group communication over IP multicast We introduce and analyze a scalable rekeying scheme for implementing secure group communications Internet protocol multicast. We show that our scheme incurs constant processing message and storage overhead for a rekey operation when a single member joins or leaves the group and logarithmic overhead for bulk simultaneous changes to the group membership. These bounds hold even when group dynamics are not known a priori. Our rekeying algorithm requires a particular clustering of the members of the secure multicast group. We describe a protocol to achieve such clustering and show that it is feasible to efficiently cluster members over realistic Internet-like topologies. We evaluate the overhead of our own rekeying scheme and also of previously published schemes via simulation over an Internet topology map containing over 280 000 routers. Through analysis and detailed simulations we show that this rekeying scheme performs better than previous schemes for a single change to group membership. Further for bulk group changes our algorithm outperforms all previously known schemes by several orders of magnitude in terms of actual bandwidth usage processing costs and storage requirements,"['scalable secure group communication', 'IP multicast', 'Internet protocol multicast', 'storage overhead', 'logarithmic overhead', 'cryptography', 'access control server', 'authentication', 'group membership', 'group dynamics', 'rekeying algorithm', 'secure multicast group', 'Internet-like topologies', 'overhead', 'simulation', 'Internet topology map', 'network routers', 'bandwidth usage', 'processing costs', 'storage requirements', 'cryptography', 'Internet', 'message authentication', 'multicast communication', 'network topology', 'telecommunication network routing', 'telecommunication security', 'transport protocols']",186,28
491,639,Distributed servers approach for large-scale secure multicast In order to offer backward and forward secrecy for multicast applications i.e. a new member cannot decrypt the multicast data sent before its joining and a former member cannot decrypt the data sent after its leaving the data encryption key has to be changed whenever a user joins or leaves the system. Such a change has to be made known to all the current users. The bandwidth used for such re-key messaging can be high when the user pool is large. We propose a distributed servers approach to minimize the overall system bandwidth and complexity by splitting the user pool into multiple groups each served by a logical server. After presenting an analytic model for the system based on a hierarchical key tree we show that there is an optimal number of servers to achieve minimum system bandwidth. As the underlying user traffic fluctuates we propose a simple dynamic scheme with low overhead where a physical server adaptively splits and merges its traffic into multiple groups each served by a logical server so as to minimize its total bandwidth. Our results show that a distributed servers approach is able to substantially reduce the total bandwidth required as compared with the traditional single-server approach especially for those applications with a large user pool short holding time and relatively low bandwidth of a data stream as in the Internet stock quote applications,"['distributed servers', 'large-scale secure multicast', 'backward secrecy', 'forward secrecy', 'multicast applications', 'data encryption key', 're-key messaging', 'system bandwidth', 'system complexity', 'hierarchical key tree', 'user traffic', 'traffic merging', 'short holding time', 'Internet stock quote applications', 'dynamic split-and-merge scheme', 'key management', 'cryptography', 'distributed processing', 'Internet', 'large-scale systems', 'multicast communication', 'stock markets', 'telecommunication traffic']",237,23
492,640,Scribe a large-scale and decentralized application-level multicast infrastructure This paper presents Scribe a scalable application-level multicast infrastructure. Scribe supports large numbers of groups with a potentially large number of members per group. Scribe is built on top of Pastry a generic peer-to-peer object location and routing substrate overlayed on the Internet and leverages Pastry's reliability self-organization and locality properties. Pastry is used to create and manage groups and to build efficient multicast trees for the dissemination of messages to each group. Scribe provides best-effort reliability guarantees and we outline how an application can extend Scribe to provide stronger reliability. Simulation results based on a realistic network topology model show that Scribe scales across a wide range of groups and group sizes. Also it balances the load on the nodes while achieving acceptable delay and link stress when compared with Internet protocol multicast,"['Scribe', 'decentralized application-level multicast infrastructure', 'scalable application-level multicast infrastructure', 'Pastry', 'generic peer-to-peer object location', 'generic routing substrate', 'Internet', 'self-organization', 'discrete event simulator', 'locality properties', 'best-effort reliability guarantees', 'simulation results', 'network topology model', 'group size', 'network nodes', 'delay', 'link stress', 'Internet protocol multicast', 'computer network reliability', 'discrete event simulation', 'Internet', 'large-scale systems', 'multicast communication', 'performance evaluation', 'self-adjusting systems', 'telecommunication network routing', 'transport protocols']",142,27
493,641,Multiecho segmented EPI with z-shimmed background gradient compensation MESBAC pulse sequence for fMRI A MultiEcho Segmented EPI with z-shimmed BAckground gradient Compensation MESBAC pulse sequence is proposed and validated for functional MRI fMRI study in regions suffering from severe susceptibility artifacts. This sequence provides an effective tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution and reduces image distortion and signal dropout. The blood oxygenation level-dependent BOLD)-weighted fMRI signal can be reliably obtained in the region of the orbitofrontal cortex OFC). To overcome physiological motion artifacts during prolonged multisegment EPI acquisition two sets of navigator echoes were acquired in both the readout and phase-encoding directions. Ghost artifacts generally produced by single-shot EPI acquisition were eliminated by separately placing the even and odd echoes in different k-space trajectories. Unlike most z-shim methods that focus on increasing temporal resolution for event-related functional brain mapping the MESBAC sequence simultaneously addresses problems of image distortion and signal dropout while maintaining sufficient temporal resolution. The MESBAC sequence will be particularly useful for pharmacological and affective fMRI studies in brain regions such as the OFC nucleus accumbens amygdala para-hippocampus etc,"['fMRI', 'multiecho segmented EPI', 'z-shimmed background gradient compensation', 'gradient compensation pulse sequence', 'severe susceptibility artifacts', 'BOLD-weighted signal', 'orbitofrontal cortex', 'navigator echoes', 'ghost artifacts', 'event-related functional brain mapping', 'signal dropout', 'spatial resolution', 'temporal resolution', 'image distortion', 'biomedical MRI', 'brain', 'image resolution', 'image segmentation', 'medical image processing', 'motion compensation']",181,20
494,642,Reconstruction of MR images from data acquired on an arbitrary k-space trajectory using the same-image weight A sampling density compensation function denoted same-image SI weight is proposed to reconstruct MR images from the data acquired on an arbitrary k-space trajectory. An equation for the SI weight is established on the SI criterion and an iterative scheme is developed to find the weight. The SI weight is then used to reconstruct images from the data calculated on a random trajectory in a numerical phantom case and from the data acquired on interleaved spirals in an in vivo experiment respectively. In addition Pipe and Menon's weight MRM 1999;41:179-186 is also used in the reconstructions to make a comparison. The images obtained with the SI weight were found to be slightly more accurate than those obtained with Pipe's weight,"['sampling density compensation', 'MRI image reconstruction', 'arbitrary k-space trajectory', 'spiral trajectory', 'same-image weight', 'random trajectory', 'convolution function', 'numerical phantom', 'Nyquist sampling conditions', 'iterative algorithm', 'weighting function', 'biomedical MRI', 'convolution', 'image reconstruction', 'image sampling', 'iterative methods', 'medical image processing']",136,17
495,643,Time-resolved contrast-enhanced imaging with isotropic resolution and broad coverage using an undersampled 3D projection trajectory Time-resolved contrast-enhanced 3D MR angiography MRA methods have gained in popularity but are still limited by the tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution. A method is presented that greatly reduces this tradeoff by employing undersampled 3D projection reconstruction trajectories. The variable density k-space sampling intrinsic to this sequence is combined with temporal k-space interpolation to provide time frames as short as 4 s. This time resolution reduces the need for exact contrast timing while also providing dynamic information. Spatial resolution is determined primarily by the projection readout resolution and is thus isotropic across the FOV which is also isotropic. Although undersampling the outer regions of k-space introduces aliased energy into the image which may compromise resolution this is not a limiting factor in high-contrast applications such as MRA. Results from phantom and volunteer studies are presented demonstrating isotropic resolution broad coverage with an isotropic field of view FOV minimal projection reconstruction artifacts and temporal information. In one application a single breath-hold exam covering the entire pulmonary vasculature generates high-resolution isotropic imaging volumes depicting the bolus passage,"['time-resolved contrast-enhanced imaging', 'isotropic resolution', 'broad coverage', 'undersampled 3D projection trajectory', '3D MRI angiography', 'variable density k-space sampling', 'temporal k-space interpolation', 'isotropic field of view', 'pulmonary vasculature', 'bolus passage', 'abdomen', 'thorax', 'image artifacts', 'breath-hold imaging', 'biomedical MRI', 'blood vessels', 'image reconstruction', 'image sampling', 'interpolation', 'lung', 'medical image processing']",191,21
496,644,Three-dimensional spiral MR imaging application to renal multiphase contrast-enhanced angiography A fast MR pulse sequence with spiral in-plane readout and conventional 3D partition encoding was developed for multiphase contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography CE-MRA of the renal vasculature. Compared to a standard multiphase 3D CE-MRA with FLASH readout an isotropic in-plane spatial resolution of 1.4*1.4 mm/sup 2 over 2.0*1.4 mm/sup 2 could be achieved with a temporal resolution of 6 sec. The theoretical gain of spatial resolution by using the spiral pulse sequence and the performance in the presence of turbulent flow was evaluated in phantom measurements. Multiphase 3D CE-MRA of the renal arteries was performed in five healthy volunteers using both techniques. A deblurring technique was used to correct the spiral raw data. Thereby the off-resonance frequencies were determined by minimizing the imaginary part of the data in image space. The chosen correction algorithm was able to reduce image blurring substantially in all MRA phases. The image quality of the spiral CE-MRA pulse sequence was comparable to that of the FLASH CE-MRA with increased spatial resolution and a 25 reduced contrast-to-noise ratio. Additionally artifacts specific to spiral MRI could be observed which had no impact on the assessment of the renal arteries,"['3D spiral MRI', 'renal multiphase contrast-enhanced angiography', 'flow artifacts', 'deblurring', 'fast pulse sequence', 'spiral in-plane readout', '3D partition encoding', 'renal vasculature', 'off-resonance frequencies', 'image quality', 'reduced contrast-to-noise ratio', 'image reconstruction', 'FLASH sequence', 'spatial resolution', 'biomedical MRI', 'blood vessels', 'image resolution', 'image restoration', 'kidney', 'medical image processing']",202,20
497,645,Oxygen-enhanced MRI of the brain Blood oxygenation level-dependent BOLD contrast MRI is a potential method for a physiological characterization of tissue beyond mere morphological representation. The purpose of this study was to develop evaluation techniques for such examinations using a hyperoxia challenge. Administration of pure oxygen was applied to test these techniques as pure oxygen can be expected to induce relatively small signal intensity SI changes compared to CO/sub 2/-containing gases and thus requires very sensitive evaluation methods. Fourteen volunteers were investigated by alternating between breathing 100 O/sub 2 and normal air using two different paradigms of administration. Changes ranged from 30 in large veins to 1.71%+or-0.14 in basal ganglia and 0.82%+or-0.08 in white matter. To account for a slow physiological response function a reference for correlation analysis was derived from the venous reaction. An objective method is presented that allows the adaptation of the significance threshold to the complexity of the paradigm used. Reference signal characteristics in representative brain tissue regions were established. As the presented evaluation scheme proved its applicability to small SI changes induced by pure oxygen it can readily be used for similar experiments with other gases,"['BOLD contrast MRI', 'oxygen-enhanced MRI', 'hyperoxia', 'brain', 'oxygen breathing', 'normal air breathing', 'physiological response function', 'correlation analysis', 'venous reaction', 'significance threshold', 'paradigm complexity', 'MRI contrast agent', 'functional imaging', 'Fourier transform Analysis', 'biomedical MRI', 'brain', 'haemodynamics', 'medical image processing']",191,18
498,646,Vibration control of structure by using tuned mass damper development of system which suppress displacement of auxiliary mass In vibration control of a structure by using an active tuned mass damper ATMD stroke of the auxiliary mass is so limited that it is difficult to control the vibration in the case of large disturbance input. In this paper two methods are proposed for the problem. One of the methods is a switching control system by two types of controllers. One of the controllers is a normal controller under small relative displacement of the auxiliary mass and the other is not effective only for first mode of vibration under large relative displacement of the auxiliary mass. New variable gain control system is constructed by switching these two controllers. The other method is the brake system. In active vibration control it is necessary to use actuator for active control. By using the actuator the proposed system puts on the brake to suppress displacement increase of the auxiliary mass under large disturbance input. Finally the systems are designed and the effectiveness of the systems is confirmed by the simulation,"['tuned mass damper', 'vibration control', 'variable gain control system', 'brake system', 'actuator', 'active control', 'auxiliary mass displacement suppression', 'controllers', 'active noise control', 'actuators', 'brakes', 'controllers', 'damping', 'gain control', 'vibration control']",186,15

502,650,Molecular descriptor selection combining genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic application to database mining procedures A new algorithm devoted to molecular descriptor selection in the context of data mining problems has been developed. This algorithm is based on the concepts of genetic algorithms GA for descriptor hyperspace exploration and combined with a stepwise approach to get local convergence. Its selection power was evaluated by a fitness function derived from a fuzzy clustering method. Different training and test sets were randomly generated at each GA generation. The fitness score was derived by combining the scores of the training and test sets. The ability of the proposed algorithm to select relevant subsets of descriptors was tested on two data sets. The first one an academic example corresponded to the artificial problem of Bullseye the second was a real data set including 114 olfactory compounds divided into three odor categories. In both cases the proposed method allowed to improve the separation between the different data set classes,"['molecular descriptor selection', 'database mining', 'data mining', 'genetic algorithms', 'fuzzy clustering method', 'fuzzy logic', 'descriptor hyperspace exploration', 'local convergence', 'stepwise approach', 'fitness function', 'test sets', 'training sets', 'fitness score', 'Bullseye', 'olfactory compounds', 'odor categories', 'chemistry computing', 'convergence of numerical methods', 'data mining', 'fuzzy logic', 'genetic algorithms', 'pattern clustering', 'scientific information systems']",163,23
503,651,Application-layer multicasting with Delaunay triangulation overlays Application-layer multicast supports group applications without the need for a network-layer multicast protocol. Here applications arrange themselves in a logical overlay network and transfer data within the overlay. We present an application-layer multicast solution that uses a Delaunay triangulation as an overlay network topology. An advantage of using a Delaunay triangulation is that it allows each application to locally derive next-hop routing information without requiring a routing protocol in the overlay. A disadvantage of using a Delaunay triangulation is that the mapping of the overlay to the network topology at the network and data link layer may be suboptimal. We present a protocol called Delaunay triangulation DT protocol which constructs Delaunay triangulation overlay networks. We present measurement experiments of the DT protocol for overlay networks with up to 10 000 members that are running on a local PC cluster with 100 Linux PCs. The results show that the protocol stabilizes quickly e.g. an overlay network with 10 000 nodes can be built in just over 30 s. The traffic measurements indicate that the average overhead of a node is only a few kilobits per second if the overlay network is in a steady state. Results of throughput experiments of multicast transmissions using TCP unicast connections between neighbors in the overlay network show an achievable throughput of approximately 15 Mb/s in an overlay with 100 nodes and 2 Mb/s in an overlay with 1000 nodes,"['application-layer multicasting', 'Delaunay triangulation overlays', 'group applications', 'network-layer multicast protocol', 'logical overlay network', 'data transfer', 'Delaunay triangulation protocol', 'measurement experiments', 'overlay networks', 'local PC cluster', 'Linux PC', 'overlay network topology', 'next-hop routing information', 'data link layer', 'DT protocol', 'network nodes', 'traffic measurements', 'average overhead', 'throughput experiments', 'multicast transmissions', 'TCP unicast connections', '15 Mbit/s', '2 Mbit/s', 'mesh generation', 'microcomputer applications', 'multicast communication', 'network topology', 'performance evaluation', 'telecommunication network routing', 'telecommunication traffic', 'transport protocols', 'workstation clusters']",240,32
504,652,A case for end system multicast The conventional wisdom has been that Internet protocol IP is the natural protocol layer for implementing multicast related functionality. However more than a decade after its initial proposal IP multicast is still plagued with concerns pertaining to scalability network management deployment and support for higher layer functionality such as error flow and congestion control. We explore an alternative architecture that we term end system multicast where end systems implement all multicast related functionality including membership management and packet replication. This shifting of multicast support from routers to end systems has the potential to address most problems associated with IP multicast. However the key concern is the performance penalty associated with such a model. In particular end system multicast introduces duplicate packets on physical links and incurs larger end-to-end delays than IP multicast. We study these performance concerns in the context of the Narada protocol. In Narada end systems self-organize into an overlay structure using a fully distributed protocol. Further end systems attempt to optimize the efficiency of the overlay by adapting to network dynamics and by considering application level performance. We present details of Narada and evaluate it using both simulation and Internet experiments. Our results indicate that the performance penalties are low both from the application and the network perspectives. We believe the potential benefits of transferring multicast functionality from end systems to routers significantly outweigh the performance penalty incurred,"['end system multicast', 'Internet protocol', 'protocol layer', 'IP multicast', 'network management', 'network scalability', 'higher layer functionality', 'congestion control', 'membership management', 'packet replication', 'network routers', 'end-to-end delays', 'Narada protocol', 'overlay structure', 'distributed protocol', 'network dynamics', 'application level performance', 'simulation', 'Internet experiments', 'performance penalties', 'self-organizing protocol', 'computer network management', 'delays', 'Internet', 'multicast communication', 'performance evaluation', 'self-adjusting systems', 'telecommunication congestion control', 'telecommunication network routing', 'transport protocols']",237,30
505,653,Indexing-neglected and poorly understood The growth of the Internet has highlighted the use of machine indexing. The difficulties in using the Internet as a searching device can be frustrating. The use of the term python is given as an example. Machine indexing is noted as rotten and human indexing as capricious. The problem seems to be a lack of a theoretical foundation for the art of indexing. What librarians have learned over the last hundred years has yet to yield a consistent approach to what really works best in preparing index terms and in the ability of our customers to search the various indexes. An attempt is made to consider the elements of indexing their pros and cons. The argument is made that machine indexing is far too prolific in its production of index terms. Neither librarians nor computer programmers have made much progress to improve Internet indexing.

507,655,Mapping CCF to MARC21 an experimental approach The purpose of this article is to raise and address a number of issues pertaining to the conversion of Common Communication Format CCF into MARC21. In this era of global resource sharing exchange of bibliographic records from one system to another is imperative in today's library communities. Instead of using a single standard to create machine-readable catalogue records more than 20 standards have emerged and are being used by different institutions. Because of these variations in standards sharing of resources and transfer of data from one system to another among the institutions locally and globally has become a significant problem. Addressing this problem requires keeping in mind that countries such as India and others in southeast Asia are using the CCF as a standard for creating bibliographic cataloguing records. This paper describes a way to map the bibliographic catalogue records from CCF to MARC21 although 100 mapping is not possible. In addition the paper describes an experimental approach that enumerates problems that may occur during the mapping of records/exchanging of records and how these problems can be overcome,"['Common Communication Format conversion', 'MARC21', 'global resource sharing', 'bibliographic records exchange', 'library communities', 'machine-readable catalogue records', 'standards', 'data transfer', 'India', 'southeast Asia', 'CCF to MARC21 mapping', 'cataloguing', 'electronic data interchange', 'library automation', 'records management', 'standards']",185,16

516,671,Expert advice  how can my organisation take advantage of reverse auctions without jeopardising existing supplier relationships In a recent survey AMR Research found that companies that use reverse auctions to negotiate prices with suppliers typically achieve savings of between 10 and 15 on direct goods and between 20 and 25 on indirect goods and can slash sourcing cycle times from months to weeks. Suppliers however are less enthusiastic. They believe that these savings are achieved only by stripping the human element out of negotiations and evaluating bids on price alone which drives down their profit margins. As a result reverse auctions carry the risk of jeopardising long-term and trusted relationships. Suppliers that have not been involved in a reverse auction before typically fear the bidding event itself  arguably the most theatrical and therefore most hyped-up part of the process.

The system under consideration is subject to time-varying norm-bounded parameter uncertainty in both the state and output matrices. We develop a new methodology for designing a linear filter such that the error variance of the filter is guaranteed to be within a certain upper bound for any allowed uncertainty and time delay. The solution is given in terms of two Riccati equations. Multiple time-delay systems are also investigated,"['robust Kalman filter', 'discrete time-delay systems', 'uncertain systems', 'state delay', 'time-varying parameter uncertainty', 'norm-bounded parameter uncertainty', 'state matrices', 'output matrices', 'linear filter', 'Riccati equations', 'robust state estimation', 'delays', 'discrete time systems', 'estimation theory', 'filtering theory', 'Kalman filters', 'matrix algebra', 'Riccati equations', 'state estimation', 'time-varying systems', 'uncertain systems']",94,21

The theorem while often very useful is incomplete in the sense that it does not explicitly specify the family of maps for which the condition is met. Here under a typically weak additional assumption on the map we show that Hadamard's condition is met if and only if the map is a homeomorphism with a Lipschitz continuous inverse.

538,694,A novel genetic algorithm for the design of a signed power-of-two coefficient quadrature mirror filter lattice filter bank A novel genetic algorithm GA for the design of a canonical signed power-of-two SPT coefficient lattice structure quadrature mirror filter bank is presented. Genetic operations may render the SPT representation of a value noncanonical. A new encoding scheme is introduced to encode the SPT values. In this new scheme the canonical property of the SPT values is preserved under genetic operations. Additionally two new features that drastically improve the performance of our GA are introduced. 1 An additional level of natural selection is introduced to simulate the effect of natural selection when sperm cells compete to fertilize an ovule this dramatically improves the offspring survival rate. A conventional GA is analogous to intracytoplasmic sperm injection and has an extremely low offspring survival rate resulting in very slow convergence. 2 The probability of mutation for each codon of a chromosome is weighted by the reciprocal of its effect. Because of these new features the performance of our new GA outperforms conventional GAs,"['genetic algorithm', 'signed power-of-two coefficient lattice structure', 'quadrature mirror filter', 'QMF', 'lattice filter bank', 'encoding scheme', 'natural selection', 'offspring survival rate', 'chromosome codon', 'signal processing', 'perfect reconstruction', 'channel bank filters', 'encoding', 'filtering theory', 'genetic algorithms', 'lattice filters', 'quadrature mirror filters', 'signal reconstruction']",179,18
539,695,Design of high-performance wavelets for image coding using a perceptual time domain criterion This paper presents a new biorthogonal linear-phase wavelet design for image compression. Instead of calculating the prototype filters as spectral factors of a half-band filter the design is based on the direct optimization of the low pass analysis filter using an objective function directly related to a perceptual criterion for image compression. This function is defined as the product of the theoretical coding gain and an index called the peak-to-peak ratio which was shown to have high correlation with perceptual quality. A distinctive feature of the proposed technique is a procedure by which given a good starting filter good filters of longer lengths are generated. The results are excellent showing a clear improvement in perceptual image quality. Also we devised a criterion for constraining the coefficients of the filters in order to design wavelets with minimum ringing,"['high-performance wavelets', 'image coding', 'perceptual time domain criterion', 'biorthogonal linear-phase wavelet design', 'image compression', 'prototype filters', 'half-band filter', 'low pass filter', 'analysis filter', 'objective function', 'coding gain', 'peak-to-peak ratio', 'perceptual image quality', 'filter banks', 'channel bank filters', 'data compression', 'image coding', 'low-pass filters', 'optimisation', 'time-domain analysis', 'transform coding', 'visual perception', 'wavelet transforms']",150,23
540,696,Design and implementation of a new sliding-mode observer for speed-sensorless control of induction machine In this letter a new sliding-mode-sensorless control algorithm is proposed for the field-oriented induction machine drive. In the proposed algorithm the terms containing flux speed and rotor time constant which are common in both current and flux equations in the current model of the induction machine are estimated by a sliding function. The flux and speed estimation accuracy is guaranteed when the error between the actual current and observed current converges to zero. Hence the fourth-order system is reduced to two second-order systems and the speed estimation becomes very simple and robust to the parameter uncertainties. The new approach is verified by simulation and experimental results,"['speed-sensorless control', 'induction machine', 'sliding-mode observer', 'induction motor drive', 'sensorless control', 'flux', 'speed', 'rotor time constant', 'flux equations', 'current equations', 'current model', 'sliding function', 'speed estimation accuracy', 'fourth-order system reduction', 'parameter uncertainties', 'induction motor drives', 'machine vector control', 'observers', 'parameter estimation', 'variable structure systems']",120,20
541,697,Schedulability analysis of real-time traffic in WorldFIP networks an integrated approach The WorldFIP protocol is one of the profiles that constitute the European fieldbus standard EN-50170. It is particularly well suited to be used in distributed computer-controlled systems where a set of process variables must be shared among network devices. To cope with the real-time requirements of such systems the protocol provides communication services based on the exchange of periodic and aperiodic identified variables. The periodic exchanges have the highest priority and are executed at run time according to a cyclic schedule. Therefore the respective schedulability can be determined at pre-run-time when building the schedule table. Concerning the aperiodic exchanges the situation is different since their priority is lower and they are bandied according to a first-come-first-served policy. In this paper a response-time-based schedulability analysis for the real-time traffic is presented. Such analysis considers both types of traffic in an integrated way according to their priorities. Furthermore a fixed-priorities-based policy is also used to schedule the periodic traffic. The proposed analysis represents an improvement relative to previous work and it can be evaluated online as part of a traffic online admission control. This feature is of particular importance when a planning scheduler is used instead of the typical offline static scheduler to allow online changes to the set of periodic process variables,"['WorldFIP Networks', 'EN-50170 European fieldbus standard', 'real-time traffic schedulability analysis', 'distributed computer-controlled systems', 'communication services', 'aperiodic exchanges', 'traffic online admission control', 'first-come-first-served policy', 'periodic process variables', 'real-time communication', 'scheduling algorithms', 'response time', 'field buses', 'protocols', 'real-time systems', 'scheduling', 'telecommunication congestion control', 'telecommunication traffic']",222,18
542,698,Robust stability analysis for current-programmed regulators Uncertainty models for the three basic switch-mode converters buck boost and buck-boost are given in this paper. The resulting models are represented by linear fractional transformations with structured dynamic uncertainties. Uncertainties are assumed for the load resistance R=R/sub O/(1+ delta sub R inductance L=L/sub O/(1+ delta sub L and capacitance C=C/sub O/(1+ delta sub C/). The interest in these models is clearly motivated by the need to have models for switch-mode DC-DC converters that are compatible with robust control analysis which require a model structure consisting of a nominal model and a norm-bounded modeling uncertainty. Therefore robust stability analysis can be realized using standard mu tools.

543,699,Novel line conditioner with voltage up/down capability In this paper a novel pulsewidth-modulated line conditioner with fast output voltage control is proposed. The line conditioner is made up of an AC chopper with reversible voltage control and a transformer for series voltage compensation. In the AC chopper a proper switching operation is achieved without the commutation problem. To absorb energy stored in line stray inductance a regenerative DC snubber can be utilized which has only one capacitor without discharging resistors or complicated regenerative circuit for snubber energy. Therefore the proposed AC chopper gives high efficiency and reliability. The output voltage of the line conditioner is controlled using a fast sensing technique of the output voltage.

544,700,Digital stochastic realization of complex analog controllers Stochastic logic is based on digital processing of a random pulse stream where the information is codified as the probability of a high level in a finite sequence. This binary pulse sequence can be digitally processed exploiting the similarity between Boolean algebra and statistical algebra. Given a random pulse sequence any Boolean operation among individual pulses will correspond to an algebraic expression among the variables represented by their respective average pulse rates. Subsequently this pulse stream can be digitally processed to perform analog operations.

The drive system consists of a three-level voltage-source converter with active front end and a synchronous motor. The drive has most recently been applied to a main strip mill. It provides a maximum of 8.3-MW mechanical power with a rated motor voltage of 3 kV.

In keeping with the need to implement very-high-power inverters switching frequency is restricted to line frequency. The study addresses device count DC filter ratings restrictions on voltage control active power transfer through the DC link and balancing of DC-link voltages. Emphasis is placed on capacitor sizing because of its impact on the cost and size of the FACTS controller. A method for the dimensioning the DC capacitor filter is presented.

In this arrangement two three-level inverters that are connected in parallel at their DC sides are feeding the open motor windings. The DSC well known from two and three-level inverters is adapted to the D3LI and optimized for a minimum torque ripple. An 18-corner trajectory is chosen for the stator flux of the induction machine since it is approaching the ideal circle much better than the hexagon known from DSC for two-level inverters without any detriment to the torque ripple.

Various assumed conditions which ensure that the NCP has a solution have been proposed. In this paper by using the notion of an exceptional family of elements we develop a sufficient condition which ensures that the solution set of the P/sub 0 function NCP is nonempty and bounded. In particular we prove that many existing assumed conditions imply this sufficient condition. Thus these conditions imply that the solution set of the P/sub 0 function NCP is nonempty and bounded. In addition we also prove directly that a few existence conditions imply that the solution set of the P/sub 0 function NCP is bounded,"['sufficient conditions', 'nonemptiness', 'boundedness', 'solution set', 'P/sub 0/ function nonlinear complementarity problem', 'functions', 'minimisation', 'set theory']",137,8

Dial-a-ride problems differ from other routing and scheduling problems in that they typically involve service-related constraints. It is common to have maximum wait time constraints and maximum ride time constraints.

561,717,A network simplex algorithm with O(n consecutive degenerate pivots We suggest a pivot rule for the primal simplex algorithm for the minimum cost flow problem known as the network simplex algorithm. Due to degeneracy cycling may occur in the network simplex algorithm. The cycling can be prevented by maintaining strongly feasible bases proposed by Cunningham 1976 however if we do not impose any restrictions on the entering variables the algorithm can still perform an exponentially long sequence of degenerate pivots. This phenomenon is known as stalling. Researchers have suggested several pivot rules with the following bounds on the number of consecutive degenerate pivots m n/sup 2 k(k + 1)/2 where n is the number of nodes in the network m is the number of arcs in the network and k is the number of degenerate arcs in the basis. Observe that k or= n. In this paper we describe an anti-stalling pivot rule that ensures that the network simplex algorithm performs at most k consecutive degenerate pivots. This rule uses a negative cost augmenting cycle to identify a sequence of entering variables,"['network simplex algorithm', 'degenerate pivots', 'minimum cost flow problem', 'degeneracy', 'cycling', 'stalling', 'anti-stalling pivot rule', 'negative cost augmenting cycle', 'computational complexity', 'minimisation', 'trees (mathematics)']",182,11

574,731,Aggregate bandwidth estimation in stored video distribution systems Multimedia applications like video on demand distance learning Internet video broadcast etc. will play a fundamental role in future broadband networks. A common aspect of such applications is the transmission of video streams that require a sustained relatively high bandwidth with stringent requirements of quality of service. In this paper various original algorithms for evaluating in a video distribution system a statistical estimation of aggregate bandwidth needed by a given number of smoothed video streams are proposed and discussed. The variable bit rate traffic generated by each video stream is characterized by its marginal distribution and by conditional probabilities between rates of temporary closed streams. The developed iterative algorithms evaluate an upper and lower bound of needed bandwidth for guaranteeing a given loss probability. The obtained results are compared with simulations and with other results based on similar assumptions already presented in the literature.

575,732,A unifying co-operative Web caching architecture Network caching of objects has become a standard way of reducing network traffic and latency in the Web. However Web caches exhibit poor performance with a hit rate of about 30%. A solution to improve this hit rate is to have a group of proxies form co-operation where objects can be cached for later retrieval. A cooperative cache system includes protocols for hierarchical and transversal caching. The drawback of such a system lies in the resulting network load due to the number of messages that need to be exchanged to locate an object. This paper proposes a new co-operative Web caching architecture which unifies previous methods of Web caching. Performance results shows that the architecture achieve up to 70 co-operative hit rate and accesses the cached object in at most two hops. Moreover the architecture is scalable with low traffic and database overhead,"['co-operative Web caching architecture', 'network caching', 'network traffic reduction', 'network latency reduction', 'co-operative hit rate', 'cooperative cache system', 'protocols', 'hierarchical caching', 'transversal caching', 'network load', 'scalable architecture', 'low traffic overhead', 'low database overhead', 'Web browser', 'World Wide Web', 'cache storage', 'file servers', 'Internet', 'memory protocols', 'online front-ends', 'telecommunication traffic']",149,21

The quantitative comparison of brain architecture across different subjects requires a common coordinate system. For the analysis of a specific brain area it is necessary to normalize and compare a region of interest and the global brain. The intensity based registration method matches the global brain well but a region of interest may not be locally normalized compared to the feature based method. The method in this paper uses feature similarities of local regions as well as intensity similarities. The lateral ventricle and central gray nuclei of the brain including the corpus callosum which is used for features in schizophrenia detection is appropriately normalized.

The present study aimed to establish a relationship between actual hemodynamic conditions and the parameters that define stenosis severity in the clinical setting. We used a computational model of the blood flow in a vessel with a blunt stenosis and an autoregulated vascular bed to simulate a stenosed blood vessel. A key point in creating realistic simulations is to properly model arterial autoregulation. A constant flow regulation mechanism resulted in CFR and FFR values that were within the physiological range while a constant wall-shear stress model yielded unrealistic values.

593,750,Automated cerebrum segmentation from three-dimensional sagittal brain MR images We present a fully automated cerebrum segmentation algorithm for full three-dimensional sagittal brain MR images. First cerebrum segmentation from a midsagittal brain MR image is performed utilizing landmarks anatomical information and a connectivity-based threshold segmentation algorithm as previously reported. Recognizing that the cerebrum in laterally adjacent slices tends to have similar size and shape we use the cerebrum segmentation result from the midsagittal brain MR image as a mask to guide cerebrum segmentation in adjacent lateral slices in an iterative fashion. This masking operation yields a masked image preliminary cerebrum segmentation for the next lateral slice which may truncate brain region(s). Truncated regions are restored by first finding end points of their boundaries by comparing the mask image and masked image boundaries and then applying a connectivity-based algorithm. The resulting final extracted cerebrum image for this slice is then used as a mask for the next lateral slice. The algorithm yielded satisfactory fully automated cerebrum segmentations in three-dimensional sagittal brain MR images and had performance superior to conventional edge detection algorithms for segmentation of cerebrum from 3D sagittal brain MR images,"['fully automated cerebrum segmentation algorithm', 'full 3D sagittal brain MR images', 'midsagittal brain MR image', 'landmarks', 'anatomical information', 'connectivity-based threshold segmentation algorithm', 'laterally adjacent slices', 'masking operation', 'brain region truncation', 'boundary end points', 'masked image boundaries', 'connectivity-based algorithm', 'biomedical MRI', 'brain', 'edge detection', 'image segmentation', 'medical image processing', 'stereo image processing']",190,18

This method basically shares certain common characteristics with PLS regression as the dependent variables play a central role in determining the latent variables to be used as predictors. Unlike PLS however the approach discussed leads to straightforward models. This method also bears some similarity to latent root regression analysis LRR that was discussed by several authors.

The platform used in conjunction with an analog front-end hardware for driving the ultrasonic transducers of any commercial echograph having the radiofrequency echo signal access make it possible to dispose of a powerful echographic system for experimenting any processing technique also in a clinical environment in which real-time operation mode is an essential prerequisite. The platform transforms any echograph into a test-system for evaluating the diagnostic effectiveness of new investigation techniques. A particular user interface was designed in order to allow a real-time and simultaneous visualization of the results produced in the different stages of the chosen processing procedure. This is aimed at obtaining a better optimization of the processing algorithm. The most important platform aspect which also constitutes the basic differentiation with respect to similar systems is the direct processing of the radiofrequency echo signal which is essential for a complete analysis of the particular ultrasound-media interaction phenomenon. The platform completely integrates the architecture of a personal computer PC giving rise to several benefits such as the quick technological evolution in the PC field and an extreme degree of programmability for different applications. The PC also constitutes the user interface as a flexible and intuitive visualization support and performs some software signal processing by custom algorithms and commercial libraries.

600,757,Ultrafast compound imaging for 2-D motion vector estimation application to transient elastography This paper describes a new technique for two-dimensional 2-D imaging of the motion vector at a very high frame rate with ultrasound. Its potential is experimentally demonstrated for transient elastography. But beyond this application it also could be promising for color flow and reflectivity imaging. To date only axial displacements induced in human tissues by low-frequency vibrators were measured during transient elastography. The proposed technique allows us to follow both axial and lateral displacements during the shear wave propagation and thus should improve Young's modulus image reconstruction. The process is a combination of several ideas well-known in ultrasonic imaging ultra-fast imaging multisynthetic aperture beamforming 1-D speckle tracking and compound imaging. Classical beamforming in the transmit mode is replaced here by a single plane wave insonification increasing the frame rate by at least a factor of 128.

601,758,Four-terminal quantum resistor network for electron-wave computing Interconnected ultrathin conducting wires or equivalently interconnected quasi-one-dimensional electron waveguides which form a quantum resistor network are presented here in four-terminal configurations. The transmission behaviors through such four-terminal networks are evaluated and classified. In addition we show that such networks can be used as the basic building blocks for a possible massive wave computing machine in the future. In a network each interconnection a node point is an elastic scatterer that routes the electron wave. Routing and rerouting of electron waves in a network is described in the framework of quantum transport from Landauer-Buttiker theory in the presence of multiple elastic scatterers. Transmissions through various types of four-terminal generalized clean Aharonov-Bohm rings are investigated at zero temperature. Useful logic functions are gathered based on the transmission probability to each terminal with the use of the Buttiker symmetry rule. In the generalized rings even and odd numbers of terminals can possess some distinctly different transmission characteristics as we have shown here and earlier. Just as an even or odd number of atoms in a ring is an important quantity for classifying the transmission behavior we show here that whether the number of terminals is an even or an odd number is just as important in understanding the physics of transmission through such a ring. Furthermore we show that there are three basic classes of four-terminal rings and the scaling relation for each class is provided. In particular the existence of equitransmission among all four terminals is shown here. This particular physical phenomena cannot exist in any three-terminal ring. Comparisons and discussions of transmission characteristics between three-terminal and four-terminal rings are also presented. The node-equation approach by considering the Kirchhoff current conservation law at each node point is used for this analysis. Many useful logic functions for electron-wave computing are shown here. In particular we show that a full adder can be constructed very simply using the equitransmission property of the four-terminal ring. This is in sharp contrast with circuits based on transistor logic,"['four-terminal quantum resistor network', 'electron-wave computing', 'interconnected ultrathin conducting wires', 'quasi1D electron waveguides', 'rerouting', 'Landauer-Buttiker theory', 'multiple elastic scatterers', 'Aharonov-Bohm rings', 'logic functions', 'transmission probability', 'Buttiker symmetry rule', 'transmission behavior', 'Kirchhoff current conservation law', 'equitransmission property', 'Aharonov-Bohm effect', 'electron waveguides', 'quantum computing', 'resistors']",339,18
602,759,Mathematical properties of dominant AHP and concurrent convergence method This study discusses the mathematical structure of the dominant AHP and the concurrent convergence method which were originally developed by Kinoshita and Nakanishi. They introduced a new concept of a regulating alternative into an analyzing tool for a simple evaluation problem with a criterion set and an alternative set. Although the original idea of the dominant AHP and the concurrent convergence method is unique the dominant AHP and the concurrent convergence method are not sufficiently analyzed in mathematical theory. This study shows that the dominant AHP consists of a pair of evaluation rules satisfying a certain property of overall evaluation vectors. This study also shows that the convergence of concurrent convergence method is guaranteed theoretically,"['dominant AHP', 'concurrent convergence method', 'overall evaluation vectors', 'convergence', 'decision theory']",124,5
603,760,An improved fuzzy MCDM model based on ideal and anti-ideal concepts Liang presented 1999 a fuzzy multiple criteria decision making MCDM method based on the concepts of ideal and anti-ideal points. Despite its merits Liang method has the following limitations i the objective criteria are converted into dimensionless indices and the subjective criteria are not converted which may prevent compatibility for these criteria ii the formulas for converting objective criteria are not reliable and iii an unreliable ranking method i.e. maximizing set and minimizing set is applied to rank the fuzzy numbers. This paper applies the Hsu and Chen method and suggests a fuzzy number ranking method to propose an improved fuzzy MCDM model based on ideal and anti-ideal concepts to overcome the shortcomings of the Liang method.

604,761,Towards a NMR implementation of a quantum lattice gas algorithm Recent theoretical results suggest that an array of quantum information processors communicating via classical channels can be used to solve fluid dynamics problems. Quantum lattice-gas algorithms QLGA running on such architectures have been shown to solve the diffusion equation and the nonlinear Burgers equations. In this report we describe progress towards an ensemble nuclear magnetic resonance NMR implementation of a QLGA that solves the diffusion equation. The methods rely on NMR techniques to encode an initial mass density into an ensemble of two-qubit quantum information processors. Using standard pulse techniques the mass density can then manipulated and evolved through the steps of the algorithm. We provide the experimental results of our first attempt to realize the NMR implementation.

612,769,Permission grids practical error-bounded simplification We introduce the permission grid a spatial occupancy grid which can be used to guide almost any standard polygonal surface simplification algorithm into generating an approximation with a guaranteed geometric error bound. In particular all points on the approximation are guaranteed to be within some user-specified distance from the original surface. Such bounds are notably absent from many current simplification methods and are becoming increasingly important for applications in scientific computing and adaptive level of detail control. Conceptually simple the permission grid defines a volume in which the approximation must lie and does not permit the underlying simplification algorithm to generate approximations outside the volume. The permission grid makes three important practical improvements over current error-bounded simplification methods. First it works on arbitrary triangular models handling all manners of mesh degeneracies gracefully. Further the error tolerance may be easily expanded as simplification proceeds allowing the construction of an error-bounded level of detail hierarchy with vertex correspondences among all levels of detail. And finally the permission grid has a representation complexity independent of the size of the input model and a small running time overhead making it more practical and efficient than current methods with similar guarantees,"['permission grid', 'spatial occupancy grid', 'polygonal surface simplification algorithm', 'guaranteed geometric error bound', 'approximation', 'error-bounded simplification', 'user-specified distance', 'scientific computing', 'adaptive level of detail control', 'arbitrary triangular models', 'mesh degeneracies', 'error tolerance', 'vertex correspondences', 'representation complexity', 'running time overhead', 'computational complexity', 'computational geometry', 'computer graphics']",201,18

The most common examples include hidden-part removal for view computation shadow boundaries mutual visibility of objects for lighting simulation. In this paper we present a theoretical study of 3D visibility properties for scenes of smooth convex objects. We work in the space of light rays or more precisely of maximal free segments. We group segments that see the same object this defines the 3D visibility complex. The boundaries of these groups of segments correspond to the visual events of the scene limits of shadows disappearance of an object when the viewpoint is moved etc.). We provide a worst case analysis of the complexity of the visibility complex of 3D scenes as well as a probabilistic study under a simple assumption for normal scenes.

614,771,Pareto-optimal formulations for cost versus colorimetric accuracy trade-offs in printer color management Color management for the printing of digital images is a challenging task due primarily to nonlinear ink-mixing behavior and the presence of redundant solutions for print devices with more than three inks. Algorithms for the conversion of image data to printer-specific format are typically designed to achieve a single predetermined rendering intent such as colorimetric accuracy. We present two CIELAB to CMYK color conversion schemes based on a general Pareto-optimal formulation for printer color management. The schemes operate using a 149-color characterization data set selected to efficiently capture the entire CMYK gamut. The first scheme uses artificial neural networks as transfer functions between the CIELAB and CMYK spaces. The second scheme is based on a reformulation of tetrahedral interpolation as an optimization problem. Characterization data are divided into tetrahedra for the interpolation-based approach using the program Qhull which removes the common restriction that characterization data be well organized. Both schemes offer user control over trade-off problems such as cost versus reproduction accuracy allowing for user-specified print objectives and the use of constraints such as maximum allowable ink and maximum allowable AE*/sub ab/. A formulation for minimization of ink is shown to be particularly favorable integrating both a clipping and gamut compression features into a single methodology,"['printer color management', 'digital image printing', 'nonlinear ink-mixing behavior', 'redundant solutions', 'Pareto-optimal formulations', 'cost versus colorimetric accuracy trade-offs', 'image data conversion', 'CIELAB to CMYK color conversion schemes', 'color characterization data set', 'artificial neural networks', 'transfer functions', 'tetrahedral interpolation', 'optimization', 'tetrahedra', 'interpolation-based approach', 'Qhull program', 'user control', 'cost versus reproduction accuracy', 'user-specified print objectives', 'maximum allowable ink', 'constraints', 'gamut compression features', 'clipping', 'MacBeth ColorChecker chart', 'grey component replacement', 'rendering intent', 'colour graphics', 'image colour analysis', 'interpolation', 'neural nets', 'optimisation', 'printers', 'rendering (computer graphics)']",218,33
615,772,Meshed atlases for real-time procedural solid texturing We describe an implementation of procedural solid texturing that uses the texture atlas a one-to-one mapping from an object's surface into its texture space. The method uses the graphics hardware to rasterize the solid texture coordinates as colors directly into the atlas. A texturing procedure is applied per-pixel to the texture map replacing each solid texture coordinate with its corresponding procedural solid texture result. The procedural solid texture is then mapped back onto the object surface using standard texture mapping. The implementation renders procedural solid textures in real time and the user can design them interactively. The quality of this technique depends greatly on the layout of the texture atlas. A broad survey of texture atlas schemes is used to develop a set of general purpose mesh atlases and tools for measuring their effectiveness at distributing as many available texture samples as evenly across the surface as possible. The main contribution of this paper is a new multiresolution texture atlas. It distributes all available texture samples in a nearly uniform distribution. This multiresolution texture atlas also supports MIP-mapped minification antialiasing and linear magnification filtering,"['real-time procedural solid texturing', 'meshed atlases', 'texture atlas', 'one-to-one mapping', 'object surface', 'texture space', 'graphics hardware', 'rasterization', 'solid texture coordinates', 'colors', 'rendering', 'multiresolution texture atlas', 'linear magnification filtering', 'MIP-mapped minification antialiasing', 'image texture', 'real-time systems', 'rendering (computer graphics)']",191,17
616,773,Topology-reducing surface simplification using a discrete solid representation This paper presents a new approach for generating coarse-level approximations of topologically complex models. Dramatic topology reduction is achieved by converting a 3D model to and from a volumetric representation. Our approach produces valid error-bounded models and supports the creation of approximations that do not interpenetrate the original model either being completely contained in the input solid or bounding it. Several simple to implement versions of our approach are presented and discussed.

622,779,Domesticating computers and the Internet The people who use computers and the ways they use them have changed substantially over the past 25 years. In the beginning highly educated people mostly men in technical professions used computers for work but over time a much broader range of people are using computers for personal and domestic purposes. This trend is still continuing and over a shorter time scale has been replicated with the use of the Internet. The paper uses data from four national surveys to document how personal computers and the Internet have become increasingly domesticated since 1995 and to explore the mechanisms for this shift. Now people log on more often from home than from places of employment and do so for pleasure and for personal purposes rather than for their jobs. Analyses comparing veteran Internet users to novices in 1998 and 2000 and analyses comparing the change in use within a single sample between 1995 and 1996 support two complementary explanations for how these technologies have become domesticated. Women children and less well-educated individuals are increasingly using computers and the Internet and have a more personal set of motives than well-educated men. In addition the widespread diffusion of the PC and the Internet and the response of the computing industry to the diversity in consumers has led to a rich set of personal and domestic services,"['computer domestication', 'Internet', 'highly educated people', 'technical professions', 'domestic purposes', 'personal usage', 'national surveys', 'personal computers', 'veteran Internet users', 'novices', 'women', 'children', 'personal motives', 'PC diffusion', 'computing industry', 'domestic services', 'demographics', 'online behavior', 'human factors', 'Internet', 'personal computing', 'social aspects of automation', 'user interfaces']",228,23
623,780,Failures and successes notes on the development of electronic cash Between 1997 and 2001 two mid-sized communities in Canada hosted North America's most comprehensive experiment to introduce electronic cash and in the process replace physical cash for casual low-value payments. The technology used was Mondex and its implementation was supported by all the country's major banks. It was launched with an extensive publicity campaign to promote Mondex not only in the domestic but also in the global market for which the Canadian implementation was to serve as a showcase. However soon after the start of the first field test it became apparent that the new technology did not work smoothly. On the contrary it created a host of controversies in areas as varied as computer security consumer privacy and monetary policy. In the following years few of these controversies could be resolved and Mondex could not be established as a widely used payment mechanism. In 2001 the experiment was finally terminated. Using the concepts developed in recent science and technology studies STS the article analyzes these controversies as resulting from the difficulties of fitting electronic cash a new sociotechnical system into the complex setting of the existing payment system. The story of Mondex not only offers lessons on why technologies fail but also offers insight into how short-term failures can contribute to long-term transformations. This suggests the need to rethink the dichotomy of success and failure,"['electronic cash', 'Canada', 'low-value payments', 'Mondex', 'major banks', 'publicity campaign', 'global market', 'Canadian implementation', 'computer security', 'consumer privacy', 'monetary policy', 'payment mechanism', 'science and technology studies', 'sociotechnical system', 'short-term failures', 'long-term transformations', 'bibliographies', 'electronic commerce', 'electronic money', 'government policies', 'management of change', 'socio-economic effects']",236,22

625,782,Community technology and democratic rationalization The objective of the paper is to explore questions of human agency and democratic process in the technical sphere through the example of virtual community. The formation of relatively stable long-term group associations community in the broad sense of the term is the scene on which a large share of human development occurs. As such it is a fundamental human value mobilizing diverse ideologies and sensitivities. The promise of realizing this value in a new domain naturally stirs up much excitement among optimistic observers of the Internet. At the same time the eagerness to place hopes for community in a technical system flies in the face of an influential intellectual tradition of technology criticism. This eagerness seems even more naive in the light of the recent commercialization of so much Internet activity. Despite the widespread skepticism we believe the growth of virtual community is significant for an inquiry into the democratization of technology. We show that conflicting answers to the central question of the present theoretical debate  Is community possible on computer networks epsilon neralize from particular features of systems and software prevalent at different stages in the development of computer networking. We conclude that research should focus instead on how to design computer networks to better support community activities and values,"['community technology', 'democratic rationalization', 'human agency', 'democratic process', 'technical sphere', 'virtual community', 'stable long-term group associations', 'human development', 'human value', 'diverse ideologies', 'optimistic observers', 'technical system', 'intellectual tradition', 'technology criticism', 'Internet activity', 'conflicting answers', 'computer networks', 'computer networking', 'community activities', 'computer networks', 'groupware', 'human factors', 'information resources', 'Internet', 'public administration', 'social sciences computing']",217,26

631,790,Data assimilation of local model error forecasts in a deterministic model One of the most popular data assimilation techniques in use today are of the Kalman filter type which provide an improved estimate of the state of a system up to the current time level based on actual measurements. From a forecasting viewpoint this corresponds to an updating of the initial conditions. The standard forecasting procedure is to then run the model uncorrected into the future driven by predicted boundary and forcing conditions. The problem with this methodology is that the updated initial conditions quickly wash-out thus after a certain forecast horizon the model predictions are no better than from an initially uncorrected model. This study demonstrates that through the assimilation of error forecasts in the present case made using so-called local models entire model domains can be corrected for extended forecast horizons i.e. long after updated initial conditions have become washed-out thus demonstrating significant improvements over the conventional methodology. Some alternate uses of local models are also explored for the re-distribution of error forecasts over the entire model domain which are then compared with more conventional Kalman filter type schemes,"['data assimilation', 'local model error forecasts', 'deterministic model', 'Kalman filter', 'forcing conditions', 'forecast horizon', 'error prediction', 'hydrodynamic modelling', 'computational fluid dynamics', 'deterministic algorithms', 'error statistics', 'hydrodynamics', 'Kalman filters']",191,13

636,795,Approximation and complexity. II. Iterated integration For pt. I. see ibid. no. 1 p. 289-95 2001). We introduce two classes of real analytic functions W contained in/implied by U on an interval. Starting with rational functions to construct functions in W we allow the application of three types of operations addition integration and multiplication by a polynomial with rational coefficients. In a similar way to construct functions in U we allow integration addition and multiplication of functions already constructed in U and multiplication by rational numbers. Thus U is a subring of the ring of Pfaffian functions. Two lower bounds on the L/sub infinity norm are proved on a function f from W or from U respectively in terms of the complexity of constructing f,"['real analytic functions', 'rational functions', 'addition', 'integration', 'multiplication', 'polynomial', 'Pfaffian functions', 'lower bounds', 'L/sub infinity /-norm', 'computational complexity', 'polynomials', 'rational functions']",125,12

Generalizing Newton's iterator is still an open problem How to design an efficient iterator with a quadratic convergence even in degenerate cases We propose an answer for an m-adic topology when the ideal m can be chosen generic enough compared to a smooth case we prove quadratic convergence with a small overhead that grows with the square of the multiplicity of the root,"['quadratic Newton iteration', 'systems with multiplicity', ""Newton's iterator"", 'polynomial equation system solvers', 'Jacobian matrix', 'quadratic convergence', 'm-adic topology', 'computational complexity', 'Jacobian matrices', 'polynomials', 'process algebra', 'series (mathematics)']",116,12
638,797,Adaptive wavelet methods. II. Beyond the elliptic case This paper is concerned with the design and analysis of adaptive wavelet methods for systems of operator equations. Its main accomplishment is to extend the range of applicability of the adaptive wavelet-based method developed previously for symmetric positive definite problems to indefinite or unsymmetric systems of operator equations. This is accomplished by first introducing techniques such as the least squares formulation developed previously that transform the original continuous problem into an equivalent infinite system of equations which is now well-posed in the Euclidean metric. It is then shown how to utilize adaptive techniques to solve the resulting infinite system of equations. It is shown that for a wide range of problems this new adaptive method performs with asymptotically optimal complexity i.e. it recovers an approximate solution with desired accuracy at a computational expense that stays proportional to the number of terms in a corresponding wavelet-best N-term approximation. An important advantage of this adaptive approach is that it automatically stabilizes the numerical procedure so that for instance compatibility constraints on the choice of trial spaces like the LBB condition no longer arise,"['adaptive wavelet methods', 'elliptic case', 'operator equations', 'least squares formulation', 'Euclidean metric', 'asymptotically optimal complexity', 'N-term approximation', 'computational complexity', 'wavelet transforms']",189,9

Finally a linear quadratic optimal feedback controller is designed and the dynamics of the closed circle system are simulated with digital calculation.

647,806,Flow measurement  future directions Interest in the flow of liquids and its measurement can be traced back to early studies by the Egyptians the Chinese and the Romans. Since these early times the science of flow measurement has undergone a massive change but during the last 25 years or so 1977-2002 it has matured enormously. One of the principal reasons for this is that higher accuracies and reliabilities have been demanded by industry in the measurement of fiscal transfers and today there is vigorous interest in the subject from both the flowmeter manufacturer and user viewpoints. This interest is coupled with the development of advanced computer techniques in fluid mechanics together with the application of increasingly sophisticated electronics,"['flow measurement', 'flow metering', 'signal processing', 'liquid flow', 'Egyptians', 'Chinese', 'Romans', 'fiscal transfers', 'flowmeter manufacturer', 'advanced computer techniques', 'fluid mechanics', 'electronics application', 'computational fluid dynamics', 'flow measurement', 'flowmeters', 'technological forecasting']",118,16

650,809,Edison's direct current influenced Broadway show lighting During the early decades of the 20 th century midtown Manhattan in New York City developed an extensive underground direct current DC power distribution system. This was a result of the original introduction of direct current by Thomas Edison's pioneering Pearl Street Station in 1882. The availability of DC power in the theater district led to the perpetuation of an archaic form of stage lighting control through nearly three-quarters of the 20 th century. This control device was known as a resistance dimmer. It was essentially a series-connected rheostat but it was wound with a special resistance taper so as to provide a uniform change in the apparent light output of typical incandescent lamps throughout the travel of its manually operated arm. The development and use of DC powered stage lighting is discussed in this article,"['Broadway show lighting', 'Manhattan', 'New York City', 'underground direct current power distribution system', ""Thomas Edison's Pearl Street Station"", 'theater district', 'stage lighting control', 'resistance dimmer', 'series-connected rheostat', 'resistance taper', 'apparent light output', 'incandescent lamps', 'DC powered stage lighting', 'DC power transmission', 'history', 'lighting control']",143,16

654,813,On generalized Gaussian quadratures for exponentials and their applications We introduce new families of Gaussian-type quadratures for weighted integrals of exponential functions and consider their applications to integration and interpolation of bandlimited functions. We use a generalization of a representation theorem due to Caratheodory to derive these quadratures. For each positive measure the quadratures are parameterized by eigenvalues of the Toeplitz matrix constructed from the trigonometric moments of the measure. For a given accuracy epsilon  selecting an eigenvalue close to epsilon yields an approximate quadrature with that accuracy. To compute its weights and nodes we present a new fast algorithm. These new quadratures can be used to approximate and integrate bandlimited functions such as prolate spheroidal wave functions and essentially bandlimited functions such as Bessel functions. We also develop for a given precision an interpolating basis for bandlimited functions on an interval,"['generalized Gaussian quadratures', 'weighted integrals', 'exponential functions', 'integration', 'interpolation', 'bandlimited functions', 'Caratheodory representation theorem', 'eigenvalues', 'Toeplitz matrix', 'trigonometric moments', 'approximation', 'prolate spheroidal wave functions', 'Bessel functions', 'approximation theory', 'Bessel functions', 'eigenvalues and eigenfunctions', 'integration', 'interpolation', 'Toeplitz matrices', 'wave functions']",142,20
655,814,A framework for image deblurring using wavelet packet bases We show that the average over translations of an operator diagonal in a wavelet packet basis is a convolution. We also show that an operator diagonal in a wavelet packet basis can be decomposed into several operators of the same kind each of them being better conditioned. We investigate the possibility of using such a convolution to approximate a given convolution in practice an image blur). Then we use these approximations to deblur images. First we show that this framework permits us to redefine existing deblurring methods. Then we show that it permits us to define a new variational method which combines the wavelet packet and the total variation approaches. We argue and show by experiments that this permits us to avoid the drawbacks of both approaches which are respectively ringing and staircasing,"['image deblurring', 'wavelet packet bases', 'convolution', 'operator diagonal', 'total variation approach', 'ringing', 'staircasing', 'deconvolution', 'convolution', 'deconvolution', 'image restoration', 'wavelet transforms']",142,12

658,817,Summarization beyond sentence extraction A probabilistic approach to sentence compression When humans produce summaries of documents they do not simply extract sentences and concatenate them. Rather they create new sentences that are grammatical that cohere with one another and that capture the most salient pieces of information in the original document. Given that large collections of text/abstract pairs are available online it is now possible to envision algorithms that are trained to mimic this process. In this paper we focus on sentence compression a simpler version of this larger challenge. We aim to achieve two goals simultaneously our compressions should be grammatical and they should retain the most important pieces of information. These two goals can conflict. We devise both a noisy-channel and a decision-tree approach to the problem and we evaluate results against manual compressions and a simple baseline,"['sentence compression', 'grammatical', 'noisy-channel', 'decision-tree', 'document summarization', 'abstracting', 'computational linguistics', 'document handling']",140,8

660,819,Local search with constraint propagation and conflict-based heuristics Search algorithms for solving CSP Constraint Satisfaction Problems usually fall into one of two main families local search algorithms and systematic algorithms. Both families have their advantages. Designing hybrid approaches seems promising since those advantages may be combined into a single approach. In this paper we present a new hybrid technique. It performs a local search over partial assignments instead of complete assignments and uses filtering techniques and conflict-based techniques to efficiently guide the search. This new technique benefits from both classical approaches a priori pruning of the search space from filtering-based search and possible repair of early mistakes from local search. We focus on a specific version of this technique tabu decision-repair. Experiments done on open-shop scheduling problems show that our approach competes well with the best highly specialized algorithms,"['search algorithms', 'CSP', 'Constraint Satisfaction Problems', 'local search algorithms', 'systematic algorithms', 'partial assignments', 'filtering techniques', 'tabu decision-repair', 'constraint handling', 'search problems']",139,10

679,838,Pool halls chips and war games women in the culture of computing Computers are becoming ubiquitous in our society and they offer superb opportunities for people in jobs and everyday life. But there is a noticeable sex difference in use of computers among children. This article asks why computers are more attractive to boys than to girls and offers a cultural framework for explaining the apparent sex differences. Although the data are fragmentary the world of computing seems to be more consistent with male adolescent culture than with feminine values and goals. Furthermore both arcade and educational software is designed with boys in mind.

680,839,Women in computing what brings them to it what keeps them in it Career stereotyping and misperceptions about the nature of computing are substantive reasons for the under representation of women in professional computing careers. In this study 15 women who have work experience in several aspects of computing were asked about their reasons for entering computing what they liked about working in computing and what they disliked. While there are many common threads there are also individual differences. Common reasons for choosing computing as a career included exposure to computing in a setting which enabled them to see the versatility of computers the influence of someone close to them personal abilities which they perceived to be appropriate for a career in computing and characteristics of such careers which appealed to them. Generally women working in the field enjoy the work they are doing. Dislikes arising from their work experiences are more likely to be associated with people and politics than with the work they do-and they would like to have more female colleagues,"['career stereotyping', 'personal abilities', 'politics', 'misperceptions', 'women', 'professional computing careers', 'computer science education', 'employment', 'gender issues', 'professional aspects']",174,10

682,841,Becoming a computer scientist The focus of this report is pipeline shrinkage for women in computer science. We describe the situation for women at all stages of training in computer science from the precollege level through graduate school. Because many of the problems discussed are related to the lack of role models for women who are in the process of becoming computer scientists we also concern ourselves with the status of women faculty members. We not only describe the problems but also make specific recommendations for change and encourage further study of those problems whose solutions are not yet well understood,"['pipeline shrinkage', 'women', 'computer science', 'role models', 'women faculty members', 'computer science education', 'gender issues']",101,7
683,842,The incredible shrinking pipeline We look at the harsh facts concerning the percentage of degrees awarded in CS to women. We study the trend of degrees awarded in CS since 1980 and compare the trend in CS to other science and engineering disciplines. We consider the relationship between the percentage of degrees awarded to women by a CS department and the college the CS department is within. We find that CS departments in engineering colleges graduate on average proportionately fewer women than CS departments in non-engineering colleges. We request that the community respond to the facts and speculations presented in this article,"['pipeline shrinkage problem', 'women', 'computer science degrees', 'science', 'engineering', 'computer science education', 'gender issues']",102,7
684,843,An ACM-W literature review on women in computing The pipeline shrinkage problem for women in computer science is a well-known and documented phenomenon where the ratio of women to men involved in computing shrinks dramatically from early student years to working years. During the last decade considerable research ensued to understand the reasons behind the existence of the shrinking pipeline and in some cases to take action to increase the numbers of women in computing. Through the work of a National Science Foundation funded project ACM's Committee on Women in Computing ACM-W has taken a first step towards pulling this research together. A large number of articles was gathered and processed on the topic of women in computing and the shrinking pipeline. The committee created a publicly available online database to organize the references of this body of work by topic author and reference information. The database constantly being updated is accessible through ACM-W's website http://www.acm.org/women>. A final report is also available via the ACM-W Web site which covers current statistics on women in computing summaries of the literature in the database and a set of recommendations. The article is a brief synopsis of a subset of the literature review as of August 2001,"['ACM-W literature review', 'ACM Committee on Women in Computing', 'pipeline shrinkage problem', 'bibliographies', 'computer science', 'computer science education', 'gender issues']",204,7
685,844,Women in computing history Exciting inventions innovative technology human interaction and intriguing politics fill computing history. However the recorded history is mainly composed of male achievements and involvements even though women have played substantial roles. This situation is not unusual. Most science fields are notorious for excluding undervaluing or overlooking the accomplishments of their female scientists. As Lee points out it is up to the historians and others to remedy this imbalance. Steps have been taken towards this goal through publishing biographies on women in technology and through honoring the pioneers with various awards such as the GHC'97 Pioneering Awards the WITI Hall of Fame and the AWC Lovelace Award. A few online sites contain biographies of women in technology. However even with these resources many women who have contributed significantly to computer science are still to be discovered,"['women', 'computing history', 'computer software', 'gender issues', 'history']",139,5
686,845,Gender software design and occupational equity After reviewing the work on gender bias in software design a model of gender-role influenced achievement choice taken from Eccles 1994 is presented. The paper concludes that 1 though laudable reduction of gender bias in software design is not the most straightforward way to reduce gender inequity in the choice of computing as a career 2 the model itself makes more clear some of the ethical issues involved in attempting to achieve gender equity on computing and 3 efforts to reduce gender inequity in the choice of computing as a career need to be evaluated in the light of this model,"['gender bias', 'software design', 'gender-role influenced achievement choice model', 'computing career', 'ethical issues', 'occupational equity', 'employment', 'gender issues', 'software engineering']",107,9
687,846,Female computer science doctorates what does the survey of earned doctorates reveal Based on the National Center for Education Statistics 2000 in the 1997-1998 academic year 26.7 of earned bachelors degrees 29.0 of earned masters degrees and 16.3 of earned doctorates degrees in computer science were awarded to women. As these percentages suggest women are underrepresented at all academic levels in computer science Camp 1997). The most severe shortage occurs at the top level-the doctorate in computer science. We know very little about the women who persist to the top level of academic achievement in computer science. This paper examines a subset of data collected through the Survey of Earned Doctorates SED). The specific focus of this paper is to identify trends that have emerged from the SED with respect to females completing doctorates in computer science between the academic years 1990-1991 and 1999-2000. Although computer science doctorates include doctorates in information science prior research Camp 1997 suggests that the percentage of women completing doctorates in information science as compared to computer science is low. The specific research questions are 1. How does the percentage of women who complete doctorates in computer science compare to those that complete doctorates in other fields 2. How does the length of time in school and the sources of funding differ for females as compared to males who complete doctorates in computer science 3. Where do women go after completing doctorates in computer science and what positions do they acquire How do these experiences differ from their male peers,"['female computer science doctorates', 'Survey of Earned Doctorates', 'information science', 'computer science education', 'gender issues', 'information science']",255,6
688,847,A gendered view of computer professionals preliminary results of a survey The under-representation of women in the computing profession in many parts the western world has received our attention through numerous publications the noticeable low representation of women at computer science conferences and in the lecture halls. Over the past two decades the situation had become worse. This paper seeks to add to the dialogue by presenting preliminary findings from a research project conducted in four countries. The aim of this research was to gain an insight into the perceptions future computer professionals hold on the category of employment loosely defined under the term of a computer professional. One goal was to get insight into whether or not there is a difference between female and mate students regarding their view of computer professionals. Other goals were to determine if there was any difference between female and male students in different parts of the world as well as who or what most influences the students to undertake their courses in computing,"['women under-representation', 'computing profession', 'future computer professional perceptions', 'employment', 'mate students', 'female students', 'computing courses', 'computer science education', 'employment', 'gender issues', 'professional aspects']",170,11

690,849,Ten years of strategies to increase participation of women in computing programs. The Central Queensland University experience 1999-2001 In the late eighties the participation rate of women in information technology courses in most Australian Universities was around 25%. This low level of women's participation in computing courses occurs not only in Australia but also overseas. More studies indicate that the participation rates have not improved and in fact may be even further in decline. Participation rates in the workforce also appear to be in decline. Concerned at the imbalance within Australia the Federal government directed all Australian Universities to increase the number of women in courses leading to a professional computing qualification i.e. information technology courses to 40 of students by 1995. This paper details one Australian university's approach over a 10 year period 1991-2001 to redress this imbalance. We provide examples of intervention strategies developed and the outcomes for these strategies. We present the outcomes against a background frame of the Australian Higher Education scene of that decade which was influenced by funding levels to universities in general and to equity programs in particular. We present data related to the participation of women in computing programs along with snapshots of the overall changing student demographics over this period,"['Central Queensland University', 'women', 'computing programs', 'demographics', 'Australian Higher Education', 'computer science education', 'demography', 'gender issues', 'management of change']",209,9

698,857,Leveraging an alternative source of computer scientists reentry programs Much has been written about the leaky pipeline of women in computer science CS with the percentage of women decreasing as one moves from lower levels such as college to higher levels culminating in full professorship. While significant attention focused on keeping women from leaving the pipeline there is also an opportunity to bring women into the pipeline through non-traditional programs instead of requiring that everyone enter at the undergraduate level. Both Mills College a small liberal arts institution for women and UC Berkeley a large research university established programs in the 80's to increase the number of women in computer science by tapping non-traditional students. Both programs share the core value of accommodating older students lacking technical backgrounds. The two programs have produced similar results graduate degrees earned in computer science by students who would not have qualified without these programs professional employment in the computer science field by women and minorities and a recognition that this population represents a rich source of talent for our nation,"['reentry programs', 'computer science', 'women', 'Mills College', 'UC Berkeley', 'graduate degrees', 'students', 'professional employment', 'minorities', 'computer science education', 'educational courses', 'gender issues']",177,12

The recommendations are based on recent and on-going research into the gender gap in computer science and related disciplines. They are intended to work in tandem with the Computing Research Association's recommendations for graduate programs to promote a general increase in women's participation in computing professions. Most of the suggestions offered could improve the educational environment for both male and female students. However general improvements are likely to be of particular benefit to women because women in our society do not generally receive the same level of support that men receive for entering and persisting in this field,"['undergraduate computing majors', 'women retention', 'women recruitment', 'female participation', 'gender gap', 'computer science', 'computer science education', 'gender issues']",118,8

702,861,The decision procedure for profitability of investment projects using the internal rate of return of single-period projects The internal rate of return IRR criterion is often used to evaluate profitability of investment projects. In this paper we focus on a single-period project which consists of two types of cash flows an investment at one period and a return at a succeeding period and a financing at one period and a repayment at a succeeding period. We decompose the given investment project into a series of the single-period projects. From the viewpoint of the single-period project we point out the applicability issue of the IRR criterion namely the IRR criterion cannot be applied in which a project is composed of both investment type and financing type. Investigating the properties of a series of the single-period projects we resolve the applicability issue of the IRR criterion and propose the decision procedure for profitability judgment toward any type of investment project based on the comparison between the IRR and the capital cost. We develop a new algorithm to obtain the value of the project investment rate PIR for the given project which is a function of the capital cost only using the standard IRR computing routine. This outcome is a theoretical breakthrough to widen the utilization of IRR in practical applications,"['decision procedure', 'investment project profitability', 'internal rate of return', 'single-period projects', 'profitability', 'cash flows', 'investment project decomposition', 'IRR criterion', 'project investment rate', 'PIR', 'decision theory', 'investment']",218,12
703,862,"Two efficient algorithms for the generalized maximum balanced flow problem Minoux 1976 considered the maximum balanced flow problem i.e. the problem of finding a maximum flow in a two-terminal network N = V,A with source s and sink t satisfying the constraint that any arc-flow of N is bounded by a fixed proportion of the total flow value from s to t where V is vertex set and A is arc set. As a generalization we focus on the problem of maximizing the total flow value of a generalized flow in N with gains gamma a  0 a in A where any arc-flow is bounded by a fixed proportion of the total flow value where gamma a)f(a units arrive at the vertex w for each arc-flow f(a a identical to  upsilon  w in A entering vertex upsilon in a generalized flow. Our main results are to propose two polynomial algorithms for this problem.

704,863,A scanline-based algorithm for the 2D free-form bin packing problem This paper describes a heuristic algorithm for the 2D free-form bin packing 2D-FBP problem. Given a set of 2D free-form bins and a set of 2D free-form items the 2D-FBP problem is to lay out items inside one or more bins in such a way that the number of bins used is minimized and for each bin the yield is maximized. The proposed algorithm handles the problem as a variant of the 1D problem i.e. items and bins are approximated as sets of scanlines and scanlines are packed. The details of the algorithm are given and its application to a nesting problem in a shipbuilding company is reported. The proposed algorithm consists of the basic and the group placement algorithms. The basic placement algorithm is a variant of the first-fit decreasing algorithm which is simply extended from the 1D case to the 2D case by a novel scanline approximation. A numerical study with real instances shows that the basic placement algorithm has sufficient performance for most of the instances however the group placement algorithm is required when items must be aligned in columns. The qualities of the resulting layouts are good enough for practical use and the processing times are good,"['scanline-based algorithm', '2D free-form bin packing problem', 'heuristic algorithm', '2D-FBP problem', 'irregular cutting', 'irregular packing', 'nesting problem', 'minimization', 'yield maximization', 'shipbuilding company', 'group placement algorithm', 'first-fit decreasing algorithm', 'bin packing', 'heuristic programming', 'minimisation']",211,15
705,864,Valuing corporate debt the effect of cross-holdings of stock and debt We have developed a simple approach to valuing risky corporate debt when corporations own securities issued by other corporations. We assume that corporate debt can be valued as an option on corporate business asset value and derive payoff functions when there exist cross-holdings of stock or debt between two firms. Next we show that payoff functions with multiple cross-holdings can be solved by the contraction principle. The payoff functions which we derive provide a number of insights about the risk structure of company cross-holdings. First the Modigliani-Miller theorem can obtain when there exist cross-holdings between firms. Second by establishing cross-shareholdings each of stock holders distributes a part of its payoff values to the bond holder of the other's firm so that both firms can decrease credit risks by cross-shareholdings. In the numerical examples we show that the correlation in firms can be a critical condition for reducing credit risk by cross-holdings of stock using Monte Carlo simulation. Moreover we show we can calculate the default spread easily when complicated cross-holdings exist and find which shares are beneficial or disadvantageous,"['risky corporate debt valuation', 'stock holdings', 'debt holdings', 'securities', 'option', 'corporate business asset value', 'payoff functions', 'multiple cross-holdings', 'Modigliani-Miller theorem', 'cross-shareholdings', 'bond holder', 'credit risks', 'correlation', 'Monte Carlo simulation', 'corporate modelling', 'correlation methods', 'Monte Carlo methods', 'stock markets']",190,18

707,866,Adjoint-based optimization of steady suction for disturbance control in incompressible flows The optimal distribution of steady suction needed to control the growth of single or multiple disturbances in quasi-three-dimensional incompressible boundary layers on a flat plate is investigated. The evolution of disturbances is analysed in the framework of the parabolized stability equations PSE). A gradient-based optimization procedure is used and the gradients are evaluated using the adjoint of the parabolized stability equations APSE and the adjoint of the boundary layer equations ABLE). The accuracy of the gradient is increased by introducing a stabilization procedure for the PSE. Results show that a suction peak appears in the upstream part of the suction region for optimal control of Tollmien-Schlichting T-S waves steady streamwise streaks in a two-dimensional boundary layer and oblique waves in a quasi-three-dimensional boundary layer subject to an adverse pressure gradient. The mean flow modifications due to suction are shown to have a stabilizing effect similar to that of a favourable pressure gradient. It is also shown that the optimal suction distribution for the disturbance of interest reduces the growth rate of other perturbations. Results for control of a steady cross-flow mode in a three-dimensional boundary layer subject to a favourable pressure gradient show that not even large amounts of suction can completely stabilize the disturbance,"['adjoint-based optimization', 'steady suction', 'disturbance control', 'incompressible flows', 'quasithree-dimensional incompressible boundary layers', 'flat plate', 'parabolized stability equations', 'gradient-based optimization procedure', 'stabilization procedure', 'Tollmien-Schlichting waves', 'steady streamwise streaks', 'oblique waves', 'adverse pressure gradient', 'mean flow', 'steady cross-flow mode', 'laminar-turbulent transition', 'aerodynamics', 'boundary layer turbulence', 'flow control', 'flow instability', 'laminar to turbulent transitions', 'optimal control', 'waves']",216,23

The model has an exactly solvable statistic the critical exponents and scaling functions of the SAT/UNSAT transition are calculable at zero temperature with no need of replicas also with exact finite-size corrections.

711,870,Speaker identification from voice using neural networks The paper provides three different schemes for speaker identification of personnel from their voice using artificial neural networks. The first scheme recognizes speakers by employing the classical backpropagation algorithm pre-trained with known voice samples of the persons. The second scheme provides a framework for classifying the known training samples of the voice features using a hierarchical architecture realized with a self-organizing feature map neural net. The first scheme is highly robust as it is capable of identifying the personnel from their noisy voice samples but because of its excessive training time it has limited applications for a large voice database. The second scheme though not so robust as the former however can classify an unknown voice sample to its nearest class. The time needed for classification by the first scheme is always unique irrespective of the voice sample. It is proportional to the number of feedforward layers in the network. The time-requirement of the second classification scheme however is not free from the voice features and is proportional to the number of 2D arrays traversed by the algorithm on the hierarchical structure. The third scheme is highly robust and mis-classification is as low as 0.2 per cent. The third scheme combines the composite benefits of a radial basis function neural net and backpropagation trained neural net,"['speaker identification', 'artificial neural networks', 'personnel', 'hierarchical architecture', 'self-organizing feature map', 'backpropagation algorithm', 'classification', 'feedforward layers', '2D arrays', 'radial basis function neural net', 'pre-training', 'known voice samples', 'backpropagation', 'pattern classification', 'radial basis function networks', 'self-organising feature maps', 'signal sampling', 'speaker recognition']",223,18
712,871,Priming the pipeline women in computer science careers In 1997 The Backyard Project a pilot program of the Garnett Foundation was instituted to encourage high school girls to explore careers in the computer industry. At that time the Garnett Foundation commissioned the Global Strategy Group to execute a survey of 652 college-bound high school students grades 9 through 12 to help discover directions that The Backyard Project might take to try to move toward the mission of the pilot program. It conducted the study by telephone between March 25 and April 8 1997 in the Silicon Valley Boston and Austin metropolitan areas.

715,874,The curious ways of professional cultures and the two-body opportunity When two professionals are a couple we sometimes refer to them as having a two-body problem. However when each partner of a couple exists in the same cultures they also have an opportunity for deeply shared understanding and empathy simply because each understands at a deep level the culture in which the other works. I explore this notion. A couple has what we call the two-body problem when both are professionals who are qualified for a kind of position that is relatively rare and who are very selective about the positions that they accept. For example there are relatively scant numbers of jobs as a computer science professor-at any level. An individual considering an academic job may only be interested in research universities or in teaching universities restricting the choice of open positions substantially. The classic two-body problem arises when one partner wants to accept a new position that requires geographical relocation. Then the other partner also needs to find a new position. Moreover it can be very difficult to find a suitable position when they are naturally scarce,"['professional cultures', 'computer science', 'two-body opportunity', 'academics', 'professional aspects']",189,5

With each entering class we think Surely now is the time when the numbers will become more balanced. Logic tells us that this must eventually happen because the opportunities in computing are simply too attractive for an entire segment of our population to routinely pass up. But each year we are again disappointed in the number of women students as they continue to be woefully under-represented among computer science majors.

In the first decade of this new century it should become apparent to everyone that the computing and information fields broadly defined will have a profound impact on every element of every person's life. The author considers how women and girls of the world have been neither educated for computing nor served by computing. Globally women's participation in computer science grew for a while then dropped precipitously. Computing science engineering and society will suffer if this decline continues because women have different perspectives on technology what it is important for how it should be built which projects should be funded and so on.

722,881,Is diversity in computing a moral matter We have presented an ethical argument that takes into consideration the subtleties of the issue surrounding under-representation in computing. We should emphasize that there is nothing subtle about overt unfair discrimination. Where such injustice occurs we condemn it. Our concern is that discrimination need not be explicit or overt. It need not be individual-to-individual. Rather it can be subtly built into social practices and social institutions. Our analysis raises ethical questions about aspects of computing that drive women away aspects that can be changed in ways that improve the profession and access to the profession. We hope that computing will move towards these improvements,"['ethical argument', 'computing under-representation', 'unfair discrimination', 'social practices', 'social institutions', 'women', 'computer science', 'gender issues', 'professional aspects', 'social aspects of automation']",111,10

724,883,On conflict-free executions of elementary nets Deals with analysis of elementary Petri nets with respect to possibilities of avoiding conflicts during their executions. There are two main aims of the paper. The first is to find a method of checking if a net is conflict-avoidable i.e. if it possesses a conflict-free fair run). The second is to find a method of rebuilding any net to a totally conflict-avoidable net i.e. a net possessing a conflict-free fair run in every one process with the same behaviour. The main results are the following 1. The proof of decidability for elementary nets of the problem of existence of a conflict-avoidable fair process and an algorithm producing all fair runs). 2. Construction for an arbitrary given elementary net of a totally conflict-avoidable net with the same behaviour. The net completed this way has the same behaviour as the original one.

728,887,Towards strong stability of concurrent repetitive processes sharing resources The paper presents a method for design of stability conditions of concurrent repetitive processes sharing common resources. Steady-state behaviour of the system with m cyclic processes utilising a resource with the mutual exclusion is considered. Based on a recurrent equations framework necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of maximal performance steady-state are presented. It was shown that if the conditions hold then the m-process system is marginally stable i.e. a steady-state of the system depends on the perturbations. The problem of finding the relative positions of the processes leading to waiting-free maximal efficiency steady-states of the system is formulated as a constraint logic programming problem. An example illustrating the solving of the problem for a 3-process system using object-oriented constraint logic programming language Oz is presented. A condition sufficient for strong stability of the m-process system is given. When the condition holds then for any initial phases of the processes a waiting-free steady-state will be reached,"['strong stability', 'concurrent repetitive processes', 'common resources', 'steady-state behaviour', 'cyclic processes', 'mutual exclusion', 'recurrent equations framework', 'necessary and sufficient conditions', 'maximal performance steady-state', 'waiting-free steady-states', 'constraint logic programming', '3-process system', 'Oz language', 'concurrency theory', 'constraint handling', 'logic programming languages', 'object-oriented methods', 'stability']",166,18
729,888,Storage functionals and Lyapunov functions for passive dynamical systems For nonlinear time-invariant input-output dynamical systems the passivity conditions are obtained under some restrictions. The conditions imply storage functions satisfying a dissipation inequality. A class of storage functions allowing unique reconstruction of a passive dynamical system is defined. These results are illustrated by an example of a linear system with fading memory. An important for practical application class of the linear relaxation systems without direct input-output interaction is considered. A necessary condition for dynamical systems to be of the relaxation type is obtained for this class. The condition is connected with the existence of a unique quadratic Lyapunov function satisfying the complete monotonicity condition. This unique Lyapunov function corresponds to a standard thermodynamic potential in a compact family of potentials in the nonequilibrium thermodynamics. The results obtained can be useful in automatic control mechanics of viscoelastic materials and various applications in physics and the system theory,"['storage functionals', 'passive dynamical systems', 'nonlinear time-invariant input-output dynamical systems', 'passivity conditions', 'dissipation inequality', 'linear system', 'fading memory', 'necessary condition', 'unique quadratic Lyapunov function', 'complete monotonicity condition', 'thermodynamic potential', 'nonequilibrium thermodynamics', 'automatic control', 'mechanics', 'viscoelastic materials', 'functional equations', 'functions', 'linear systems', 'Lyapunov methods', 'nonlinear systems']",155,20
730,889,Synthesis of the control systems via reflection onto auxiliary surfaces An approach to robust control systems synthesis both linear and nonlinear and nonstationary is offered. The control is carried out providing the given phase constraints varied in acceptable limits in view of constraints on its value and incompleteness of the information about functioning disturbances. The approach is based on the introduction of auxiliary integral surfaces on which the initial moving is projected. As a result the reduced equivalent moving is formed being described by the scalar equation which in many important cases can be integrated directly. On the basis of the equation obtained solving a synthesis task is carried out and can be reduced to algebraic or integral inequalities. The final relations defined for linear equivalent moving are presented,"['control systems synthesis', 'auxiliary surfaces', 'robust control systems', 'linear systems', 'nonlinear systems', 'algebraic inequalities', 'integral inequalities', 'linear equivalent moving', 'algebra', 'control system synthesis', 'integral equations', 'linear systems', 'nonlinear control systems', 'robust control']",129,14
731,890,Multiple criteria decision making without optimization We present a development intended to make interactive decision making schemes accessible for a wider spectrum of decision makers. To this aim we propose to eliminate the need to solve optimization problems at successive iterations of interactive decision processes. We show that the need for optimization can be eliminated by the ability of establishing sufficiently tight bounds on criteria values for efficient decisions prior to explicit identification of such decisions. We present a technique fully operational and numerically simple for establishing such bounds. Bounds are dynamic i.e. they become stronger with the growing number of decisions explicitly identified. They are also parametric with respect to weighting coefficients. We also point out how this technique can enhance the existing interactive decision making methods,"['multiple criteria decision making', 'interactive decision making schemes', 'decision makers', 'criteria values bounds', 'efficient decisions', 'computational complexity', 'convergence', 'decision theory']",128,8

Twenty solitary lung nodules smaller than 30 mm in diameter including 10 lung cancers and 10 benign nodules were used. The nodules were grouped subjectively according to their subtlety. For nonnodular cases 20 nodules without perceptible interval changes were selected. All chest radiographs were obtained by using a computed radiographic system and temporal subtraction images were produced by using a program developed at the University of Chicago. The effect of the temporal subtraction image was evaluated by using an observer performance study with use of receiver operating characteristic analysis. Observer performance with temporal subtraction images was substantially improved A/sub z = 0.980 and 0.958 as compared with that without temporal subtraction images A/sub z = 0.920 and 0.825 for the certified radiologists and radiology residents respectively.

744,903,Modeling and simulation of an ABR flow control algorithm using a virtual source/virtual destination switch The available bit rate ABR service class of asynchronous transfer mode networks uses a feedback control mechanism to adapt to varying link capacities. The virtual source/virtual destination VS/VD technique offers the possibility of segmenting the otherwise end-to-end ABR control loop into separate loops. The improved feedback delay and control of ABR traffic inside closed segments provide a better performance for ABR connections. This article presents the use of classical linear control theory to model and develop an ABR VS/VD flow control algorithm. Discrete event simulations are used to analyze the behavior of the algorithm with respect to transient behavior and correctness of the control model. Linear control theory offers the means to derive correct choices of parameters and to assess performance issues such as stability of the system during the design phase. The performance goals are high link utilization fair bandwidth distribution and robust operation in various environments which are verified by discrete event simulations.

745,904,Modeling and simulation of adaptive available bit rate voice over asynchronous transfer mode networks This article presents a modeling and simulation methodology to analyze the performance of voice quality when sent over the available bit rate service in asynchronous transfer mode networks. Sources can modify the rate at which they send traffic to the network based on the feedback carried in the resource management cells. This is achieved by changing the encoding level. As the contention increases to network resources-bandwidth in this case-sources start reducing the rate at which they generate and send traffic. The efficiency of the scheme under different scheduling/drop policies and other operating conditions and environments is evaluated using simulation modeling. Furthermore sensitivity analysis is applied to different parameters such as queue size and averaging interval length to investigate their impact on the performance metrics. Results show that limiting the load to 41 of the link capacity results in an acceptable quality,"['simulation', 'modeling', 'performance analysis', 'voice quality', 'traffic', 'feedback', 'resource management cells', 'encoding level', 'bandwidth contention', 'scheduling/drop policies', 'queue size', 'averaging interval length', 'performance metrics', 'link capacity', 'adaptive available bit rate voice', 'ATM networks', 'asynchronous transfer mode', 'digital simulation', 'speech coding', 'telecommunication computing', 'telecommunication traffic', 'voice communication']",155,22
746,905,Ultra-high speed positioning control of a gravure engraving unit using a discrete-time two-degree-of-freedom H/sub infinity  control The piezoelectric actuator has high-speed response in comparison with the electro-magnetic actuator. However it is not easy to achieve both high-speed and high-precision response by feedforward control only because the piezoelectric element has nonlinear properties such as the hysteresis effect. Thus feedback control is required to achieve good performance. We develop a control design method to achieve both high-speed and high-precision response for piezoelectric actuators using the discrete-time H/sub infinity  control method and the two-degree-of-freedom control scheme.

751,910,Control of a heavy-duty robotic excavator using time delay control with integral sliding surface The control of a robotic excavator is difficult from the standpoint of the following problems parameter variations in mechanical structures various nonlinearities in hydraulic actuators and disturbance due to the contact with the ground. In addition the more the size of robotic excavators increases the more the length and mass of the excavator links the more the parameters of a heavy-duty excavator vary. A time-delay control with switching action TDCSA using an integral sliding surface is proposed in this paper for the control of a 21-ton robotic excavator. Through analysis and experiments we show that using an integral sliding surface for the switching action of TDCSA is better than using a PD-type sliding surface. The proposed controller is applied to straight-line motions of a 21-ton robotic excavator with a speed level at which skillful operators work. Experiments which were designed for surfaces with various inclinations and over broad ranges of joint motions show that the proposed controller exhibits good performance,"['time-delay control', 'robust control', 'robotic excavator', 'integral sliding surface', 'motion control', 'trajectory control', 'dynamics', 'tracking', 'pressure control', 'delay systems', 'dynamics', 'excavators', 'industrial robots', 'motion control', 'pressure control', 'robust control', 'tracking', 'variable structure systems']",174,18
752,911,Scheduling schemes for an integrated flight and propulsion control system We describe two schemes for scheduling an integrated flight and propulsion control system for an experimental vertical/short take-off and landing V/STOL aircraft concept in the acceleration from hover 0-120 kn flight phase. Multivariable integrated flight and propulsion controllers are designed at several points over the V/STOL envelope and implemented as exact plant observers with state feedback. In the first scheduling scheme the values of the state feedback and observer gain matrices are interpolated between the fixed-point designs as a function of aircraft speed. In the second approach the control signals produced by the different fixed-point controllers are blended allowing a significant reduction in the order of the scheduled controllers. Both scheduling schemes are shown in nonlinear simulation to provide excellent handling qualities as the aircraft accelerates from the hover,"['vertical short take-off landing aircraft', 'VSTOL aircraft', 'propulsion control', 'flight control', 'scheduling', 'multivariable control systems', 'observers', 'state feedback', 'fixed-point controllers', 'aerospace propulsion', 'aircraft control', 'multivariable control systems', 'observers', 'scheduling', 'state feedback']",139,15
753,912,Grey-box model identification via evolutionary computing This paper presents an evolutionary grey-box model identification methodology that makes the best use of a priori knowledge on a clear-box model with a global structural representation of the physical system under study whilst incorporating accurate blackbox models for immeasurable and local nonlinearities of a practical system. The evolutionary technique is applied to building dominant structural identification with local parametric tuning without the need of a differentiable performance index in the presence of noisy data. It is shown that the evolutionary technique provides an excellent fitting performance and is capable of accommodating multiple objectives such as to examine the relationships between model complexity and fitting accuracy during the model building process. Validation results show that the proposed method offers robust uncluttered and accurate models for two practical systems. It is expected that this type of grey-box models will accommodate many practical engineering systems for a better modelling accuracy,"['system identification', 'grey-box models', 'evolutionary algorithms', 'genetic evolution', 'multiobjective optimisation', 'hydraulic system', 'nonlinear system', 'genetic algorithms', 'hydraulic systems', 'identification', 'nonlinear systems']",154,11
754,913,Control of a coupled map lattice model for vortex shedding in the wake of a cylinder The flow behind a vibrating flexible cable at low Reynolds numbers can exhibit complex wake structures such as lace-like patterns vortex dislocations and frequency cells. These structures have been observed in experiments and numerical simulations and are predicted by a previously developed low-order coupled map lattice CML). The discrete in time and space CML models consist of a series of diffusively coupled circle map oscillators along the cable span. Motivated by a desire to modify the complex wake patterns behind flexible vibrating cables we have studied the addition of control terms into the highly efficient CML models and explored the resulting dynamics. Proportional adaptive proportional and discontinuous non-linear DNL control methods were used to derive the control laws. The first method employed occasional proportional feedback. The adaptive method used spatio-temporal feedback control. The DNL method used a discontinuous feedback linearization procedure and the controller was designed for the resulting linearized system using eigenvalue assignment. These techniques were applied to a modeled vortex dislocation structure in the wake of a vibrating cable in uniform freestream flow. Parallel shedding patterns were achieved for a range of forcing frequency-forcing amplitude combinations studied to validate the control theory. The adaptive proportional and DNL methods were found to be more effective than the proportional control method due to the incorporation of a spatially varying feedback gain across the cylinder span. The DNL method was found to be the most efficient controller of the low-order CML model. The required control level across the cable span was correlated to the 1/1 lock-on behavior of the temporal circle map,"['coupled map lattice', 'vortex shedding', 'wake', 'proportional feedback', 'coupled circle map oscillators', 'spatio-temporal feedback control', 'temporal circle map', 'vortex dislocation', '1/1 lock-on', 'discontinuous nonlinear control', 'cylinder', 'low Reynolds numbers', 'vortex dislocations', 'vibrating flexible cable', 'feedback', 'lattice theory', 'nonlinear control systems', 'proportional control', 'vortices', 'wakes']",277,20
755,914,A knowledge management framework for the support of decision making in humanitarian assistance/disaster relief The major challenge in current humanitarian assistance/disaster relief HA/DR efforts is that diverse information and knowledge are widely distributed and owned by different organizations. These resources are not efficiently organized and utilized during HA/DR operations. We present a knowledge management framework that integrates multiple information technologies to collect analyze and manage information and knowledge for supporting decision making in HA/DR. The framework will help identify the information needs be aware of a disaster situation and provide decision-makers with useful relief recommendations based on past experience. A comprehensive consistent and authoritative knowledge base within the framework will facilitate knowledge sharing and reuse.

756,915,A meteorological fuzzy expert system incorporating subjective user input We present a fuzzy expert system MEDEX for forecasting gale-force winds in the Mediterranean basin. The most successful local wind forecasting in this region is achieved by an expert human forecaster with access to numerical weather prediction products. That forecaster's knowledge is expressed as a set of rules-of-thumb'. Fuzzy set methodologies have proved well suited for encoding the forecaster's knowledge and for accommodating the uncertainty inherent in the specification of rules as well as in subjective and objective input. MEDEX uses fuzzy set theory in two ways as a fuzzy rule base in the expert system and for fuzzy pattern matching to select dominant wind circulation patterns as one input to the expert system. The system was developed tuned and verified over a two-year period during which the weather conditions from 539 days were individually analyzed. Evaluations of MEDEX performance for both the onset and cessation of winter and summer winds are presented and demonstrate that MEDEX has forecasting skill competitive with the US Navy's regional forecasting center in Rota Spain,"['meteorological fuzzy expert system', 'subjective user input', 'MEDEX', 'gale-force wind forecasting', 'Mediterranean basin', 'numerical weather prediction products', 'rules-of-thumb', 'fuzzy set theory', 'subjective variables', 'uncertainty', 'rule specification', 'fuzzy rule base', 'fuzzy pattern matching', 'wind circulation patterns', 'expert systems', 'fuzzy logic', 'fuzzy set theory', 'geophysics computing', 'pattern matching', 'uncertainty handling', 'weather forecasting']",180,21
757,916,Attribute generation based on association rules A decision tree is considered to be appropriate 1 if the tree can classify the unseen data accurately and 2 if the size of the tree is small. One of the approaches to induce such a good decision tree is to add new attributes and their values to enhance the expressiveness of the training data at the data pre-processing stage. There are many existing methods for attribute extraction and construction but constructing new attributes is still an art. These methods are very time consuming and some of them need a priori knowledge of the data domain. They are not suitable for data mining dealing with large volumes of data. We propose a novel approach that the knowledge on attributes relevant to the class is extracted as association rules from the training data. The new attributes and the values are generated from the association rules among the originally given attributes. We elaborate on the method and investigate its feature. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through some experiments,"['attribute generation', 'association rules', 'decision tree', 'training data', 'attribute extraction', 'data mining', 'large database', 'experiments', 'data mining', 'decision trees', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'very large databases']",174,12
758,917,Efficient transitive closure reasoning in a combined class/part/containment hierarchy Class hierarchies form the backbone of many implemented knowledge representation and reasoning systems. They are used for inheritance classification and transitive closure reasoning. Part hierarchies are also important in artificial intelligence. Other hierarchies e.g. containment hierarchies have received less attention in artificial intelligence. This paper presents an architecture and an implementation of a hierarchy reasoner that integrates a class hierarchy a part hierarchy and a containment hierarchy into one structure. In order to make an implemented reasoner useful it needs to operate at least at speeds comparable to human reasoning. As real-world hierarchies are always large special techniques need to be used to achieve this. We have developed a set of parallel algorithms and a data representation called maximally reduced tree cover for that purpose. The maximally reduced tree cover is an improvement of a materialized transitive closure representation which has appeared in the literature. Our experiments with a medical vocabulary show that transitive closure reasoning for combined class/part/containment hierarchies in near constant time is possible for a fixed hardware configuration,"['transitive closure reasoning', 'knowledge representation', 'class hierarchy', 'part hierarchy', 'containment hierarchy', 'parallel algorithms', 'data representation', 'maximally reduced tree cover', 'materialized transitive closure representation', 'experiments', 'medical vocabulary', 'fixed hardware configuration', 'parallel reasoning', 'inheritance', 'part hierarchies', 'artificial intelligence', 'classification', 'inference mechanisms', 'knowledge representation', 'medical computing', 'parallel algorithms', 'tree data structures', 'vocabulary']",180,23
759,918,Schema evolution in data warehouses We address the issues related to the evolution and maintenance of data warehousing systems when underlying data sources change their schema capabilities. These changes can invalidate views at the data warehousing system. We present an approach for dynamically adapting views according to schema changes arising on source relations. This type of maintenance concerns both the schema and the data of the data warehouse. The main issue is to avoid the view recomputation from scratch especially when views are defined from multiple sources. The data of the data warehouse is used primarily in organizational decision-making and may be strategic. Therefore the schema of the data warehouse can evolve for modeling new requirements resulting from analysis or data-mining processing. Our approach provides means to support schema evolution of the data warehouse independently of the data sources,"['schema evolution', 'data warehouses', 'system maintenance', 'containment', 'data sources', 'source relations', 'structural view maintenance', 'view adaptation', 'SQL query', 'organizational decision-making', 'data analysis', 'business data processing', 'data warehouses', 'query processing', 'relational databases', 'SQL']",139,16

762,921,Processing of complexly shaped multiply connected domains in finite element mesh generation Large number of finite element models in modern materials science and engineering is defined on complexly shaped domains quite often multiply connected.

764,923,Design and manufacture of a lightweight piezo-composite curved actuator In this paper we are concerned with the design manufacture and performance test of a lightweight piezo-composite curved actuator called LIPCA using a top carbon fiber composite layer with near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion CTE a middle PZT ceramic wafer and a bottom glass/epoxy layer with a high CTE. The main point of the design for LIPCA is to replace the heavy metal layers of THUNDER TM by lightweight fiber reinforced plastic layers without losing the capabilities for generating high force and large displacement. It is possible to save up to about 40 of the weight if we replace the metallic backing material by the light fiber composite layer. We can also have design flexibility by selecting the fiber direction and the size of prepreg layers. In addition to the lightweight advantage and design flexibility the proposed device can be manufactured without adhesive layers when we use an epoxy resin prepreg system. Glass/epoxy prepregs a ceramic wafer with electrode surfaces and a carbon prepreg were simply stacked and cured at an elevated temperature 177 degrees C after following an autoclave bagging process. We found that the manufactured composite laminate device had a sufficient curvature after being detached from a flat mould. An analysis method using the classical lamination theory is presented to predict the curvature of LIPCA after curing at an elevated temperature. The predicted curvatures are in quite good agreement with the experimental values. In order to investigate the merits of LIPCA performance tests of both LIPCA and THUNDER TM have been conducted under the same boundary conditions. From the experimental actuation tests it was observed that the developed actuator could generate larger actuation displacement than THUNDER TM,"['performance test', 'lightweight piezo-composite curved actuator', 'LIPCA', 'carbon fiber composite layer', 'near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion', 'PZT ceramic wafer', 'glass/epoxy layer', 'fiber reinforced plastic layers', 'predicted curvatures', 'performance tests', 'boundary conditions', 'THUNDER', '177 degrees C', '177 degC', 'glass fibre reinforced composites', 'intelligent actuators', 'intelligent structures', 'piezoelectric actuators', 'thermal expansion']",288,19
765,924,Dynamic testing of inflatable structures using smart materials In this paper we present experimental investigations of the vibration testing of an inflated thin-film torus using smart materials. Lightweight inflatable structures are very attractive in satellite applications. However the lightweight flexible and highly damped nature of inflated structures poses difficulties in ground vibration testing. In this study we show that polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF patches and recently developed macro-fiber composite actuators may be used as sensors and actuators in identifying modal parameters. Both smart materials can be integrated unobtrusively into the skin of a torus or space device forming an attractive testing arrangement. The addition of actuators and PVDF sensors to the torus does not significantly interfere with the suspension modes of a free-free boundary condition and can be considered an integral part of the inflated structure.

766,925,A fundamental investigation into large strain recovery of one-way shape memory alloy wires embedded in flexible polyurethanes Shape memory alloys SMAs are being embedded in or externally attached to smart structures because of the large amount of actuation deformation and force that these materials are capable of producing when they are heated. Previous investigations have focused primarily on using single or opposing SMA wires exhibiting the two-way shape memory effect SME because of the simplicity with which the repeatable actuation behavior of the structure can be predicted. This repeatable actuation behavior is achieved at the expense of reduced levels of recoverable deformation. Alternatively many potential smart structure applications will employ multiple SMA wires exhibiting a permanent one-way SME to simplify fabrication and increase the recoverable strains in the structure. To employ the one-way wires it is necessary to investigate how they affect the recovery of large strains when they are embedded in a structure. In this investigation the large strain recovery of a one-way SMA wire embedded in a flexible polyurethane is characterized using the novel deformation measurement technique known as digital image correlation. These results are compared with a simple actuation model and a three-dimensional finite element analysis of the structure using the Brinson model for describing the thermomechanical behavior of the SMA. Results indicate that the level of actuation strain in the structure is substantially reduced by the inelastic behavior of the one-way SMA wires and there are significant differences between the deformations of the matrix material adjacent to the SMA wires and in the region surrounding it. The transformation behavior of the SMA wires was also determined to be volume preserving which had a significant effect on the transverse strain fields,"['strain recovery', 'one-way shape memory', 'flexible polyurethanes', 'alloy wires', 'SMA wires', 'actuation deformation', 'two-way shape memory effect', 'recoverable strains', 'flexible polyurethane', 'embedded sensor', 'smart structures', 'three-dimensional finite element analysis', 'actuation strain', 'deformations', 'matrix material', 'transverse strain fields', 'composite materials', 'finite element analysis', 'intelligent actuators', 'intelligent control', 'intelligent structures', 'shape memory effects', 'strain control', 'strain measurement']",284,24

769,928,Weighted energy linear quadratic regulator vibration control of piezoelectric composite plates In this paper on finite element linear quadratic regulator LQR vibration control of smart piezoelectric composite plates we propose the use of the total weighted energy method to select the weighting matrices. By constructing the optimal performance function as a relative measure of the total kinetic energy strain energy and input energy of the system only three design variables need to be considered to achieve a balance between the desired higher damping effect and lower input cost. Modal control analysis is used to interpret the effects of three energy weight factors on the damping ratios and modal voltages and it is shown that the modal damping effect will increase with the kinetic energy weight factor approaching square root 2/2 as the strain energy weight factor increases and decrease with the input energy weight factor. Numerical results agree well with those from the modal control analysis. Since the control problem is simplified to three design variables only the computational cost will be greatly reduced and a more accurate structural control analysis becomes more attractive for large systems,"['finite element linear quadratic regulator', 'vibration control', 'smart piezoelectric composite plates', 'total weighted energy', 'weighting matrices', 'optimal performance function', 'total kinetic energy', 'strain energy', 'damping effect', 'modal control analysis', 'damping ratios', 'strain energy weight factor', 'numerical results', 'computational cost', 'structural control analysis', 'composite materials', 'control system analysis computing', 'feedback', 'finite element analysis', 'intelligent actuators', 'intelligent control', 'intelligent structures', 'optimal control', 'piezoelectric actuators', 'structural engineering computing', 'vibration control']",187,26

The parametric study includes the different control gains as well as geometric parameters related to the active constrained layer damping ACLD treatment. Comparisons are made among several ACLD models the passive constrained model and the active damping model. The results obtained here reiterate that ACLD is somewhat better for vibration suppression than either the purely passive or the active system and provides higher structural damping with less control gain when compared to the purely active system.

This formulation is made to couple certain piezoelectric constants to a transverse electric field to develop extension-bending actuation and shear-induced actuation. As an illustration we present a sandwich model of three sublaminates face/core/face. We develop a control scheme based on the linear quadratic regulator/independent modal space control LQR/IMSC method and use this to estimate the active stiffness and the active damping introduced by shear and extension-bending actuators.

As a result the in-plane displacements are not involved and the out-of-plane displacement of the laminate is the only quantity to be calculated.

774,933,Real-time estimations of multi-modal frequencies for smart structures In this paper various methods for the real-time estimation of multi-modal frequencies are realized in real time and compared through numerical and experimental tests. These parameter-based frequency estimation methods can be applied to various engineering fields such as communications radar and adaptive vibration and noise control. Well-known frequency estimation methods are introduced and explained. The Bairstow method is introduced to find the roots of a characteristic equation for estimations of multi-modal frequencies and the computational efficiency of the Bairstow method is shown quantitatively. For a simple numerical test we consider two sinusoids of the same amplitudes mixed with various amounts of white noise. The test results show that the auto regressive AR and auto regressive and moving average ARMA methods are unsuitable in noisy environments. The other methods apart from the AR method have fast tracking capability. From the point of view of computational efficiency the results reveal that the ARMA method is inefficient while the cascade notch filter method is very effective. The linearized adaptive notch filter and recursive maximum likelihood methods have average performances. Experimental tests are devised to confirm the feasibility of real-time computations and to impose the severe conditions of drastically different amplitudes and of considerable changes of natural frequencies. We have performed experiments to extract the natural frequencies from the vibration signal of wing-like composite plates in real time. The natural frequencies of the specimen are changed by added masses. Especially the AR method exhibits a remarkable performance in spite of the severe conditions.

775,934,Induced-shear piezoelectric actuators for rotor blade trailing edge flaps Much of the current rotorcraft research is focused on improving performance by reducing unwanted helicopter noise and vibration. One of the most promising active rotorcraft vibration control systems is an active trailing edge flap. In this paper an induced-shear piezoelectric tube actuator is used in conjunction with a simple lever-cusp hinge amplification device to generate a useful combination of trailing edge flap deflections and hinge moments. A finite-element model of the actuator tube and trailing edge flap including aerodynamic and inertial loading was used to guide the design of the actuator-flap system. A full-scale induced shear tube actuator flap system was fabricated and bench top testing was conducted to validate the analysis. Hinge moments corresponding to various rotor speeds were applied to the actuator using mechanical springs. The testing demonstrated that for an applied electric field of 3 kV cm/sup 1 the tube actuator deflected a representative full-scale 12 inch flap +or-2.8 degrees at 0 rpm and +or-1.4 degrees for a hinge moment simulating a 400 rpm condition. The per cent error between the predicted and experimental full-scale flap deflections ranged from 4 low rpm to 12.5 large rpm). Increasing the electric field to 4 kV cm/sup 1 results in +or-2.5 degrees flap deflection at a rotation speed of 400 rpm according to the design analysis. A trade study was conducted to compare the performance of the piezoelectric tube actuator to the state of the art in trailing edge flap actuators and indicated that the induced-shear tube actuator shows promise as a trailing edge flap actuator,"['rotorcraft', 'helicopter noise', 'helicopter vibration', 'vibration control', 'active trailing edge flap', 'lever-cusp hinge amplification device', 'finite-element model', 'aerodynamic loading', '12 inch flap', 'inertial loading', 'design', 'shear tube actuator flap', 'bench top testing', 'piezoelectric tube actuator', 'induced-shear tube actuator', '12 inch', 'aircraft control', 'finite element analysis', 'helicopters', 'noise abatement', 'piezoelectric actuators', 'rotors', 'vibration control']",265,23
776,935,Experimental feedforward and feedback control of a one-dimensional SMA composite The control of embedded shape memory alloy SMA actuators has recently become a topic of interest in the field of smart structures. The inherent difficulties associated with SMA actuators has resulted in a variety of approaches. Homogenization provides a simplified yet mathematically rigorous method of determining average stress and strain fields in a composite. A modified constitutive model is presented based on experimental results demonstrating the inability of most simple phenomenological models to capture the effective behavior of SMAs during thermal activation.

777,936,Resonant controllers for smart structures In this paper we propose a special type of colocated feedback controller for smart structures. The controller is a parallel combination of high-Q resonant circuits. Each of the resonant circuits is tuned to a pole or the resonant frequency of the smart structure. It is proven that the parallel combination of resonant controllers is stable with an infinite gain margin.

778,937,Use of neural networks in the analysis of particle size distribution by laser diffraction tests with different particle systems The application of forward light scattering methods for estimating the particle size distribution PSD is usually limited by the occurrence of multiple scattering which affects the angular distribution of light in highly concentrated suspensions thus resulting in false calculations by the conventionally adopted algorithms. In this paper a previously proposed neural network-based method is tested with different particle systems in order to evaluate its applicability. In the first step of the study experiments were carried out with solid-liquid suspensions having different characteristics of particle shape and size distribution under varying solid concentrations. The experimental results consisting of the angular distribution of light intensity particle shape and suspension concentration were used as input data in the fitting of neural network models NN that replaced the optical model to provide the PSD. The reference values of particle shape and PSD for the NN fitting were based on image analysis. Comparisons between the PSD values computed by the NN model and the reference values indicate that the method can be used in monitoring the PSD of particles with different shapes in highly concentrated suspensions thus extending the range of application of forward laser diffraction to a number of systems with industrial interest,"['particle size distribution', 'laser diffraction', 'neural network modeling', 'forward light scattering', 'multiple scattering', 'angular distribution of light', 'solid-liquid suspensions', 'particle shape distribution', 'image analysis', 'pattern recognition', 'powdered materials', 'backpropagation algorithm', 'Fraunhofer optical model', 'fluidized catalytic cracking', 'backpropagation', 'Fraunhofer diffraction', 'light scattering', 'measurement by laser beam', 'neural nets', 'particle size measurement', 'pattern recognition', 'physics computing', 'suspensions']",218,23
779,938,Fast accurate MEG source localization using a multilayer perceptron trained with real brain noise Iterative gradient methods such as Levenberg-Marquardt LM are in widespread use for source localization from electroencephalographic EEG and magnetoencephalographic MEG signals. Unfortunately LM depends sensitively on the initial guess necessitating repeated runs. This combined with LM's high per-step cost makes its computational burden quite high. To reduce this burden we trained a multilayer perceptron MLP as a realtime localizer. We used an analytical model of quasistatic electromagnetic propagation through a spherical head to map randomly chosen dipoles to sensor activities according to the sensor geometry of a 4D Neuroimaging Neuromag-122 MEG system and trained a MLP to invert this mapping in the absence of noise or in the presence of various sorts of noise such as white Gaussian noise correlated noise or real brain noise. A MLP structure was chosen to trade off computation and accuracy. This MLP was trained four times with each type of noise. We measured the effects of initial guesses on LM performance which motivated a hybrid MLP-start-LM method in which the trained MLP initializes LM. We also compared the localization performance of LM MLPs and hybrid MLP-start-LMs for realistic brain signals. Trained MLPs are much faster than other methods while the hybrid MLP-start-LMs are faster and more accurate than fixed-4-start-LM. In particular the hybrid MLP-start-LM initialized by a MLP trained with the real brain noise dataset is 60 times faster and is comparable in accuracy to random-20-start-LM and this hybrid system localization error 0.28 cm computation time 36 ms shows almost as good performance as optimal-1-start-LM localization error 0.23 cm computation time 22 ms which initializes LM with the correct dipole location. MLPs trained with noise perform better than the MLP trained without noise and the MLP trained with real brain noise is almost as good an initial guesser for LM as the correct dipole location,"['MEG source localization', 'fast accurate localization', 'multilayer perceptron', 'real brain noise', 'real-time localizer', 'analytical model', 'quasistatic electromagnetic propagation', 'spherical head', 'white Gaussian noise', 'correlated noise', 'computation accuracy', 'Levenberg-Marquardt method', 'iterative gradient methods', 'forward model', 'Gaussian noise', 'gradient methods', 'inverse problems', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'magnetoencephalography', 'medical signal processing', 'multilayer perceptrons', 'white noise']",315,22

It is shown that exact and stable reconstruction of a given region-of-interest in the object does not require all lines passing through the object to be measured. Complete non-truncated fan-beam projections provide sufficient information for reconstruction when every line passing through the region-of-interest intersects the vertex path in a non-tangential way'.

781,940,Tools for the analysis of dose optimization. I. Effect-volume histogram With the advent of dose optimization algorithms predominantly for intensity-modulated radiotherapy IMRT computer software has progressed beyond the point of being merely a tool at the hands of an expert and has become an active independent mediator of the dosimetric conflicts between treatment goals and risks. To understand and control the internal decision finding as well as to provide means to influence it a tool for the analysis of the dose distribution is presented which reveals the decision-making process performed by the algorithm. The internal trade-offs between partial volumes receiving high or low doses are driven by functions which attribute a weight to each volume element. The statistics of the distribution of these weights is cast into an effect-volume histogram EVH in analogy to dose-volume histograms. The analysis of the EVH reveals which traits of the optimum dose distribution result from the defined objectives and which are a random consequence of under or misspecification of treatment goals. The EVH can further assist in the process of finding suitable objectives and balancing conflicting objectives. If biologically inspired objectives are used the EVH shows the distribution of local dose effect relative to the prescribed level,"['dose optimization algorithms', 'effect-volume histogram', 'intensity-modulated radiotherapy', 'dosimetric conflicts', 'treatment goals', 'treatment risks', 'computer software', 'decision-making process', 'partial volumes', 'high doses', 'low doses', 'volume element weights', 'treatment planning', 'objective function', 'insufficient target coverage', 'exponential law', 'cell survival', 'one-sided quadratic penalties', 'quadratic overdose penalty', 'decision theory', 'dosimetry', 'graphs', 'medical computing', 'optimisation', 'radiation therapy', 'software tools']",203,26

786,945,Testing statistical bounds on entanglement using quantum chaos Previous results indicate that while chaos can lead to substantial entropy production thereby maximizing dynamical entanglement this still falls short of maximality. Random matrix theory modeling of composite quantum systems investigated recently entails a universal distribution of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices. We demonstrate that these distributions are realized in quantized chaotic systems by using a model of two coupled and kicked tops. We derive an explicit statistical universal bound on entanglement which is also valid for the case of unequal dimensionality of the Hilbert spaces involved and show that this describes well the bounds observed using composite quantized chaotic systems such as coupled tops,"['statistical bounds', 'entanglement', 'quantum chaos', 'entropy production', 'maximality', 'random matrix theory', 'composite quantum systems', 'universal distribution', 'reduced density matrices', 'quantized chaotic systems', 'kicked tops', 'Hilbert spaces', 'bound states', 'chaos', 'eigenvalues and eigenfunctions', 'entropy', 'Hilbert spaces', 'matrix algebra', 'quantisation (quantum theory)', 'quantum communication', 'quantum theory']",115,21

788,947,The fully entangled fraction as an inclusive measure of entanglement applications Characterizing entanglement in all but the simplest case of a two qubit pure state is a hard problem even understanding the relevant experimental quantities that are related to entanglement is difficult. It may not be necessary however to quantify the entanglement of a state in order to quantify the quantum information processing significance of a state. It is known that the fully entangled fraction has a direct relationship to the fidelity of teleportation maximized under the actions of local unitary operations. In the case of two qubits we point out that the fully entangled fraction can also be related to the fidelities maximized under the actions of local unitary operations of other important quantum information tasks such as dense coding entanglement swapping and quantum cryptography in such a way as to provide an inclusive measure of these entanglement applications. For two qubit systems the fully entangled fraction has a simple known closed-form expression and we establish lower and upper bounds of this quantity with the concurrence.

Two heuristics based on the number of structural levels of circuitry looked at and the total number of nodes in the BDD manager are used to control the BDD sizes and introduce new cutsets based on already found equivalent nodes.

800,960,Bisimulation minimization and symbolic model checking State space minimization techniques are crucial for combating state explosion. A variety of explicit-state verification tools use bisimulation minimization to check equivalence between systems to minimize components before composition or to reduce a state space prior to model checking. Experimental results on bisimulation minimization in symbolic model checking contexts however are mixed. We explore bisimulation minimization as an optimization in symbolic model checking of invariance properties. We consider three bisimulation minimization algorithms. From each we produce a BDD-based model checker for invariant properties and compare this model checker to a conventional one based on backwards reachability. Our comparisons both theoretical and experimental suggest that bisimulation minimization is not viable in the context of invariance verification because performing the minimization requires as many if not more computational resources as model checking the unminimized system through backwards reachability,"['bisimulation minimization', 'symbolic model checking', 'state space minimization techniques', 'state explosion', 'explicit-state verification tools', 'experimental results', 'optimization', 'invariance properties', 'BDD', 'binary decision diagram', 'backwards reachability', 'invariance verification', 'binary decision diagrams', 'bisimulation equivalence', 'formal verification', 'minimisation', 'reachability analysis']",142,17
801,961,Modular and visual specification of hybrid systems an introduction to HyCharts Visual description techniques are particularly important for the design of hybrid systems because specifications of such systems usually have to be discussed between engineers from a number of different disciplines. Modularity is vital for hybrid systems not only because it allows to handle large systems but also because it permits to think in terms of components which is familiar to engineers. Based on two different interpretations for hierarchic graphs and on a clear hybrid computation model we develop HyCharts. HyCharts consist of two modular visual formalisms one for the specification of the architecture and one for the specification of the behavior of hybrid systems. The operators on hierarchic graphs enable us to give a surprisingly simple denotational semantics for many concepts known from statechart-like formalisms. Due to a very general composition operator HyCharts can easily be composed with description techniques from other engineering disciplines. Such heterogeneous system specifications seem to be particularly appropriate for hybrid systems because of their interdisciplinary character,"['visual specification', 'modular specification', 'hybrid systems', 'HyCharts', 'visual description techniques', 'components', 'hierarchic graphs', 'hybrid computation model', 'denotational semantics', 'statechart', 'heterogeneous system specifications', 'formal specification', 'diagrams', 'formal specification', 'graph theory', 'programming language semantics', 'visual programming']",172,17
802,962,Optimal control using the transport equation the Liouville machine Transport theory describes the scattering behavior of physical particles such as photons. Here we show how to connect this theory to optimal control theory and to adaptive behavior of agents embedded in an environment. Environments and tasks are defined by physical boundary conditions. Given some task we compute a set of probability densities on continuous state and action and time. From these densities we derive an optimal policy such that for all states the most likely action maximizes the probability of reaching a predefined goal state. Liouville's conservation theorem tells us that the conditional density at time t state s and action a must equal the density at t + dt s + ds a + da. Discretization yields a linear system that can be solved directly and whose solution corresponds to an optimal policy. Discounted reward schemes are incorporated naturally by taking the Laplace transform of the equations.

803,963,A computational model of learned avoidance behavior in a one-way avoidance experiment We present a computational model of learned avoidance behavior in a one-way avoidance experiment. Our model employs the reinforcement learning paradigm and a temporal-difference algorithm to implement both classically conditioned and instrumentally conditioned components. The role of the classically conditioned component is to develop an expectation of future benefit that is a function of the learning system's state and action. Competition among the instrumentally conditioned components determines the overt behavior generated by the learning system. Our model displays in simulation the reduced latency of the avoidance behavior during learning with continuing trials and the resistance to extinction of the avoidance response. These results are consistent with experimentally observed animal behavior.

The control objective is then to regulate the energy with respect to a shaped nominal representation implicitly related to system trajectories.

809,969,Controlled projective synchronization in nonpartially-linear chaotic systems Projective synchronization PS in which the state vectors synchronize up to a scaling factor is usually observable only in partially linear systems. We show that PS could by means of control be extended to general classes of chaotic systems with nonpartial linearity. Performance of PS may also be manipulated by controlling the scaling factor to any desired value. In numerical experiments we illustrate the applications to a Rossler system and a Chua's circuit.

811,971,Homogenization in L/sup infinity  Homogenization of deterministic control problems with L/sup infinity  running cost is studied by viscosity solutions techniques. It is proved that the value function of an L/sup infinity  problem in a medium with a periodic micro-structure converges uniformly on the compact sets to the value function of the homogenized problem as the period shrinks to 0. Our main convergence result extends that of Ishii Stochastic Analysis control optimization and applications pp. 305-324 Birkhauser Boston Boston MA 1999. to the case of a discontinuous Hamiltonian. The cell problem is solved but as nonuniqueness occurs the effective Hamiltonian must be selected in a careful way.

813,973,Time-integration of multiphase chemistry in size-resolved cloud models The existence of cloud drops leads to a transfer of chemical species between the gas and aqueous phases. Species concentrations in both phases are modified by chemical reactions and by this phase transfer. The model equations resulting from such multiphase chemical systems are nonlinear highly coupled and extremely stiff. In the paper we investigate several numerical approaches for treating such processes. The droplets are subdivided into several classes. This decomposition of the droplet spectrum into classes is based on their droplet size and the amount of scavenged material inside the drops respectively. The very fast dissociations in the aqueous phase chemistry are treated as forward and backward reactions. The aqueous phase and gas phase chemistry the mass transfer between the different droplet classes among themselves and with the gas phase are integrated in an implicit and coupled manner by the second order BDF method. For this part we apply a modification of the code LSODE with special linear system solvers. These direct sparse techniques exploit the special block structure of the corresponding Jacobian. Furthermore we investigate an approximate matrix factorization which is related to operator splitting at the linear algebra level. The sparse Jacobians are generated explicitly and stored in a sparse form.

816,976,Completion to involution and semidiscretisations We discuss the relation between the completion to involution of linear over-determined systems of partial differential equations with constant coefficients and the properties of differential algebraic equations obtained by their semidiscretisation. For a certain class of weakly over-determined systems we show that the differential algebraic equations do not contain hidden constraints if and only if the original partial differential system is involutive. We also demonstrate how the formal theory can be used to obtain an existence and uniqueness theorem for smooth solutions of strongly hyperbolic systems and to estimate the drift off the constraints if an underlying equation is numerically solved. Finally we show for general linear systems how the index of differential algebraic equations obtained by semidiscretisations can be predicted from the result of a completion of the partial differential system,"['completion', 'involution', 'linear over-determined systems', 'partial differential equations', 'matrices', 'semidiscretisations', 'constant coefficients', 'index', 'differential algebraic equations', 'uniqueness theorem', 'strongly hyperbolic systems', 'hyperbolic equations', 'matrix algebra', 'partial differential equations']",137,14

It is shown that projected and half-explicit Runge-Kutta methods reproduce the qualitative features of the continuous system in the vicinity of an equilibrium correctly.

818,978,On Implicit Euler for high-order high-index DAEs The Implicit Euler method is seldom used to solve differential-algebraic equations DAEs of differential index r or= 3 since the method in general fails to converge in the first r  2 steps after a change of stepsize. However if the differential equation is of order d = r  1 or= 1 an alternative variable-step version of the Euler method can be shown uniformly convergent. For d = r  1 this variable-step method is equivalent to the Implicit Euler except for the first r  2 steps after a change of stepsize.

821,981,Basin configuration of a six-dimensional model of an electric power system As part of an ongoing project on the stability of massively complex electrical power systems we discuss the global geometric structure of contacts among the basins of attraction of a six-dimensional dynamical system. This system represents a simple model of an electrical power system involving three machines and an infinite bus. Apart from the possible occurrence of attractors representing pathological states the contacts between the basins have a practical importance from the point of view of the operation of a real electrical power system. With the aid of a global map of basins one could hope to design an intervention strategy to boot the power system back into its normal state. Our method involves taking two-dimensional sections of the six-dimensional state space and then determining the basins directly by numerical simulation from a dense grid of initial conditions. The relations among all the basins are given for a specific numerical example that is choosing particular values for the parameters in our model,"['basin configuration', 'six-dimensional model', 'electric power system', 'massively complex electrical power systems', 'global geometric structure', 'infinite bus', 'attractors', 'pathological states', 'global map', 'state space', 'power system stability', 'bifurcation', 'chaos', 'geometry', 'limit cycles', 'nonlinear dynamical systems', 'power system dynamic stability', 'transforms']",173,18

823,983,Limitations of delayed state feedback a numerical study Stabilization of a class of linear time-delay systems can be achieved by a numerical procedure called the continuous pole placement method Michiels et al. 2000]. This method can be seen as an extension of the classical pole placement algorithm for ordinary differential equations to a class of delay differential equations. In Michiels et al. 2000 it was applied to the stabilization of a linear time-invariant system with an input delay using static state feedback. In this paper we study the limitations of such delayed state feedback laws. More precisely we completely characterize the class of stabilizable plants in the 2D-case. For that purpose we make use of numerical continuation techniques. The use of delayed state feedback in various control applications and the effect of its limitations are briefly discussed,"['linear time-delay systems', 'continuous pole placement method', 'delay differential equations', 'static state feedback', 'delayed state feedback', 'numerical continuation', 'delay-differential systems', 'differential equations', 'iterative methods', 'state feedback']",137,10
824,984,Bistability of harmonically forced relaxation oscillations Relaxation oscillations appear in processes which involve transitions between two states characterized by fast and slow time scales. When a relaxation oscillator is coupled to an external periodic force its entrainment by the force results in a response which can include multiple periodicities and bistability. The prototype of these behaviors is the harmonically driven van der Pol equation which displays regions in the parameter space of the driving force amplitude where stable orbits of periods 2n+or-1 coexist flanked by regions of periods 2n+1 and 2n-1. The parameter regions of such bistable orbits are derived analytically for the closely related harmonically driven Stoker-Haag piecewise discontinuous equation. The results are valid over most of the control parameter space of the system. Also considered are the reasons for the more complicated dynamics featuring regions of high multiple periodicity which appear like noise between ordered periodic regions. Since this system mimics in detail the less analytically tractable forced van der Pol equation the results suggest extensions to situations where forced relaxation oscillations are a component of the operating mechanisms,"['bistability', 'harmonically forced relaxation oscillations', 'external periodic force', 'entrainment', 'van der Pol equation', 'harmonically driven Stoker-Haag piecewise discontinuous equation', 'control parameter space', 'nonlinear dynamics', 'bifurcation', 'nonlinear control systems', 'nonlinear dynamical systems', 'oscillations', 'piecewise constant techniques', 'relaxation', 'relaxation oscillators']",181,15
825,985,Local activity criteria for discrete-map CNN Discrete-time CNN systems are studied in this paper by the application of Chua's local activity principle. These systems are locally active everywhere except for one isolated parameter value. As a result nonhomogeneous spatiotemporal patterns may be induced by any initial setting of the CNN system when the strength of the system diffusion coupling exceeds a critical threshold. The critical coupling coefficient can be derived from the loaded cell impedance of the CNN system. Three well-known 1D map CNN's namely the logistic map CNN the magnetic vortex pinning map CNN and the spiral wave reproducing map CNN are introduced to illustrate the applications of the local activity principle. In addition we use the cell impedance to demonstrate the period-doubling scenario in the logistic and the magnetic vortex pinning maps,"['discrete-time CNN systems', 'local activity criteria', 'difference equation', 'discrete-map CNN', 'loaded cell impedance', ""Chua's local activity principle"", 'nonhomogeneous spatiotemporal patterns', 'critical coupling coefficient', 'logistic map CNN', 'magnetic vortex pinning map CNN', 'spiral wave reproducing map CNN', 'period-doubling', 'cellular neural nets', 'chaos', 'difference equations']",134,15

It is shown that problems encountered in the system are classified as three classes of problems F fault-tolerant NF Not fault-tolerant and NFC NF-completeness). Among those the class NFC are the hardest problems to solve.

828,988,A new merging algorithm for constructing suffix trees for integer alphabets A new approach for constructing a suffix tree T/sub s for a given string S is to construct recursively a suffix tree T/sub o for odd positions construct a suffix tree T/sub e for even positions from T/sub o and then merge T/sub o and T/sub e into T/sub s/. To construct suffix trees for integer alphabets in linear time had been a major open problem on index data structures. Farach used this approach and gave the first linear-time algorithm for integer alphabets. The hardest part of Farach's algorithm is the merging step. In this paper we present a new and simpler merging algorithm based on a coupled BFS breadth-first search).

829,989,A dynamic checkpoint scheduling scheme for fault tolerant distributed computing systems The selection of the optimal checkpointing interval has been a very critical issue in implementing checkpointing-recovery schemes for fault tolerant distributed systems. This paper presents a new scheme that allows a process to select the proper checkpointing interval dynamically. A process in the system evaluates the cost of checkpointing and possible rollback for each checkpointing interval and selects the proper time interval for the next checkpointing. Unlike the other schemes the overhead incurred by both the checkpointing and rollback activities are considered for the cost evaluation and the current communication pattern is reflected in the selection of the checkpointing interval. Moreover the proposed scheme requires no extra message communication for the checkpointing interval selection and can easily be incorporated into the existing checkpointing coordination schemes,"['dynamic checkpoint scheduling scheme', 'fault tolerant computing', 'distributed computing systems', 'optimal checkpointing interval', 'rollback recovery', 'cost evaluation', 'communication pattern', 'distributed processing', 'fault tolerant computing', 'processor scheduling', 'system recovery']",136,11

831,991,Estimation of blocking probabilities in cellular networks with dynamic channel assignment Blocking probabilities in cellular mobile communication networks using dynamic channel assignment are hard to compute for realistic sized systems. This computational difficulty is due to the structure of the state space which imposes strong coupling constraints amongst components of the occupancy vector. Approximate tractable models have been proposed which have product form stationary state distributions. However for real channel assignment schemes the product form is a poor approximation and it is necessary to simulate the actual occupancy process in order to estimate the blocking probabilities. Meaningful estimates of the blocking probability typically require an enormous amount of CPU time for simulation since blocking events are usually rare. Advanced simulation approaches use importance sampling IS to overcome this problem. We study two regimes under which blocking is a rare event low-load and high cell capacity. Our simulations use the standard clock SC method. For low load we propose a change of measure that we call static ISSC which has bounded relative error. For high capacity we use a change of measure that depends on the current state of the network occupancy. This is the dynamic ISSC method. We prove that this method yields zero variance estimators for single clique models and we empirically show the advantages of this method over naive simulation for networks of moderate size and traffic loads,"['blocking probability estimation', 'dynamic channel assignment', 'cellular mobile communication networks', 'strong coupling constraints', 'occupancy vector', 'approximate tractable models', 'product form stationary state distributions', 'CPU time', 'simulation', 'importance sampling', 'low-load', 'high cell capacity', 'standard clock method', 'static ISSC method', 'bounded relative error', 'quality of service', 'dynamic ISSC method', 'zero variance estimators', 'single clique models', 'network traffic load', 'cellular radio', 'channel allocation', 'digital simulation', 'importance sampling', 'probability', 'quality of service', 'telecommunication computing', 'telecommunication traffic']",230,28

For the maximal cut problem the proposed algorithm employs an auxiliary Bernoulli distribution which transforms the original deterministic network into an associated stochastic one called the associated stochastic network ASN). Each iteration of the randomized algorithm for the ASN involves the following two phases 1 generation of random cuts using a multidimensional Ber(p distribution and calculation of the associated cut lengths objective functions and some related quantities such as rare-event probabilities 2 updating the parameter vector p on the basis of the data collected in the first phase.

833,993,A large deviations analysis of the transient of a queue with many Markov fluid inputs approximations and fast simulation This article analyzes the transient buffer content distribution of a queue fed by a large number of Markov fluid sources. We characterize the probability of overflow at time t given the current buffer level and the number of sources in the on-state. After scaling buffer and bandwidth resources by the number of sources n we can apply large deviations techniques. The transient overflow probability decays exponentially in n. In the case of exponential on/off sources we derive an expression for the decay rate of the rare event probability under consideration. For general Markov fluid sources we present a plausible conjecture. We also provide the most likely path from the initial state to overflow at time t). Knowledge of the decay rate and the most likely path to overflow leads to i approximations of the transient overflow probability and ii efficient simulation methods of the rare event of buffer overflow.

834,994,Design and implementation of a flexible manufacturing control system using neural network Design and implementation of a sequential controller based on the concept of artificial neural networks for a flexible manufacturing system are presented. The recurrent neural network RNN type is used for such a purpose. Contrary to the programmable controller an RNN-based sequential controller is based on a definite mathematical model rather than depending on the experience and trial and error techniques. The proposed controller is also more flexible because it is not limited by the restrictions of the finite state automata theory. Adequate guidelines of how to construct an RNN-based sequential controller are presented. These guidelines are applied to different case studies. The proposed controller is tested by simulations and real-time experiments. These tests prove the successfulness of the proposed controller performances.

840,1000,Does classicism explain universality Arguments against a pure classical component of mind One of the hallmarks of human cognition is the capacity to generalize over arbitrary constituents. Marcus Cognition 66 p.153 Cognitive Psychology 37 p. 243 1998 argued that this capacity called universal generalization universality is not supported by connectionist models. Instead universality is best explained by classical symbol systems with connectionism as its implementation. Here it is argued that universality is also a problem for classicism in that the syntax-sensitive rules that are supposed to provide causal explanations of mental processes are either too strict precluding possible generalizations or too lax providing no information as to the appropriate alternative. Consequently universality is not explained by a classical theory,"['classicism', 'universality', 'classical component of mind', 'human cognition', 'universal generalization', 'connectionist models', 'classical symbol systems', 'syntax-sensitive rules', 'causal explanations', 'mental processes', 'cognitive systems', 'neural nets', 'philosophical aspects']",119,13
841,1001,A conflict between language and atomistic information Fred Dretske and Jerry Fodor are responsible for popularizing three well-known theses in contemporary philosophy of mind the thesis of Information-Based Semantics IBS the thesis of Content Atomism Atomism and the thesis of the Language of Thought LOT). LOT concerns the semantically relevant structure of representations involved in cognitive states such as beliefs and desires. It maintains that all such representations must have syntactic structures mirroring the structure of their contents. IBS is a thesis about the nature of the relations that connect cognitive representations and their parts to their contents semantic relations). It holds that these relations supervene solely on relations of the kind that support information content perhaps with some help from logical principles of combination. Atomism is a thesis about the nature of the content of simple symbols. It holds that each substantive simple symbol possesses its content independently of all other symbols in the representational system. I argue that Dretske's and Fodor's theories are false and that their falsehood results from a conflict IBS and Atomism on the one hand and LOT on the other,"['philosophy of mind', 'Information-Based Semantics', 'Content Atomism', 'IBS', 'Language of Thought', 'LOT', 'cognitive states', 'beliefs', 'desires', 'artificial intelligence', 'cognitive systems', 'philosophical aspects']",186,12
842,1002,Selective representing and world-making We discuss the thesis of selective representing-the idea that the contents of the mental representations had by organisms are highly constrained by the biological niches within which the organisms evolved. While such a thesis has been defended by several authors elsewhere our primary concern here is to take up the issue of the compatibility of selective representing and realism. We hope to show three things. First that the notion of selective representing is fully consistent with the realist idea of a mind-independent world. Second that not only are these two consistent but that the latter the realist conception of a mind-independent world provides the most powerful perspective from which to motivate and understand the differing perceptual and cognitive profiles themselves. Third that the genuine and important sense in which organism and environment may together constitute an integrated system of scientific interest poses no additional threat to the realist conception,"['world-making', 'selective representing', 'mental representations', 'organisms', 'realism', 'mind-independent world', 'cognitive profiles', 'artificial intelligence', 'cognitive systems']",153,9
843,1003,Lob's theorem as a limitation on mechanism We argue that Lob's Theorem implies a limitation on mechanism. Specifically we argue via an application of a generalized version of Lob's Theorem that any particular device known by an observer to be mechanical cannot be used as an epistemic authority of a particular type by that observer either the belief-set of such an authority is not mechanizable or if it is there is no identifiable formal system of which the observer can know or truly believe it to be the theorem-set. This gives we believe an important and hitherto unnoticed connection between mechanism and the use of authorities by human-like epistemic agents,"['Lob Theorem', 'limitation on mechanism', 'epistemic authority', 'belief-set', 'formal system', 'theorem-set', 'human-like epistemic agents', 'belief maintenance', 'cognitive systems', 'inference mechanisms']",110,10
844,1004,Games machines play Individual rationality or doing what is best for oneself is a standard model used to explain and predict human behavior and von Neumann-Morgenstern game theory is the classical mathematical formalization of this theory in multiple-agent settings. Individual rationality however is an inadequate model for the synthesis of artificial social systems where cooperation is essential since it does not permit the accommodation of group interests other than as aggregations of individual interests. Satisficing game theory is based upon a well-defined notion of being good enough and does accommodate group as well as individual interests through the use of conditional preference relationships whereby a decision maker is able to adjust its preferences as a function of the preferences and not just the options of others. This new theory is offered as an alternative paradigm to construct artificial societies that are capable of complex behavior that goes beyond exclusive self interest,"['individual rationality', 'human behavior', 'game theory', 'multiple-agent', 'artificial social systems', 'cooperation', 'conditional preference relationships', 'artificial societies', 'self interest', 'decision theory', 'group rationality', 'artificial intelligence', 'cognitive systems', 'decision theory', 'game theory']",151,15
845,1005,The average-case identifiability and controllability of large scale systems Needs for increased product quality reduced pollution and reduced energy and material consumption are driving enhanced process integration. This increases the number of manipulated and measured variables required by the control system to achieve its objectives. This paper addresses the question of whether processes tend to become increasingly more difficult to identify and control as the process dimension increases. Tools and results of multivariable statistics are used to show that under a variety of assumed distributions on the elements square processes of higher dimension tend to be more difficult to identify and control whereas the expected controllability and identifiability of nonsquare processes depends on the relative numbers of measured and manipulated variables. These results suggest that the procedure of simplifying the control problem so that only a square process is considered is a poor practice for large scale systems,"['large scale systems', 'average-case identifiability', 'average-case controllability', 'enhanced process integration', 'process control', 'multivariable statistics', 'high dimension square processes', 'nonsquare processes', 'measured variables', 'manipulated variables', 'process identification', 'Monte Carlo simulations', 'chemical engineering', 'chemical technology', 'controllability', 'higher order statistics', 'identification', 'large-scale systems', 'Monte Carlo methods', 'multivariable control systems', 'process control', 'transfer functions']",148,22
846,1006,Robust model-order reduction of complex biological processes This paper addresses robust model-order reduction of a high dimensional nonlinear partial differential equation PDE model of a complex biological process. Based on a nonlinear distributed parameter model of the same process which was validated against experimental data of an existing pilot-scale biological nutrient removal BNR activated sludge plant we developed a state-space model with 154 state variables. A general algorithm for robustly reducing the nonlinear PDE model is presented and based on an investigation of five state-of-the-art model-order reduction techniques we are able to reduce the original model to a model with only 30 states without incurring pronounced modelling errors. The singular perturbation approximation balanced truncating technique is found to give the lowest modelling errors in low frequency ranges and hence is deemed most suitable for controller design and other real-time applications,"['complex biological processes', 'robust model-order reduction', 'high dimensional nonlinear partial differential equation model', 'nonlinear distributed parameter model', 'pilot-scale BNR activated sludge plant', 'state-space model', 'singular perturbation approximation balanced truncating technique', 'modelling errors', 'controller design', 'Hankel singular values', 'biological nutrient removal activated sludge processes', 'biotechnology', 'control system synthesis', 'nonlinear control systems', 'nonlinear differential equations', 'partial differential equations', 'reduced order systems', 'robust control', 'singularly perturbed systems', 'state-space methods', 'water treatment']",140,21
847,1007,Conditions for decentralized integral controllability The term decentralized integral controllability DIC pertains to the existence of stable decentralized controllers with integral action that have closed-loop properties such as stable independent detuning. It is especially useful to select control structures systematically at the early stage of control system design because the only information needed for DIC is the steady-state process gain matrix. Here a necessary and sufficient condition conjectured in the literature is proved. The real structured singular value which can exploit realness of the controller gain is used to describe computable conditions for DIC. The primary usage of DIC is to eliminate unworkable pairings. For this two other simple necessary conditions are proposed. Examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed conditions for DIC,"['decentralized integral controllability', 'necessary sufficient conditions', 'stable decentralized controllers', 'integral action', 'closed-loop properties', 'stable independent detuning', 'control system design', 'systematic control structure selection', 'steady-state process gain matrix', 'real structured singular value', 'controller gain realness', 'unworkable pairing elimination', 'Schur complement', 'closed loop systems', 'control system synthesis', 'controllability', 'decentralised control', 'matrix algebra', 'root loci']",126,19
848,1008,Quadratic programming algorithms for large-scale model predictive control Quadratic programming QP methods are an important element in the application of model predictive control MPC). As larger and more challenging MPC applications are considered more attention needs to be focused on the construction and tailoring of efficient QP algorithms. In this study we tailor and apply a new QP method called QPSchur to large MPC applications such as cross directional control problems in paper machines. Written in C++ QPSchur is an object oriented implementation of a novel dual space Schur complement algorithm. We compare this approach to three widely applied QP algorithms and show that QPSchur is significantly more efficient up to two orders of magnitude than the other algorithms. In addition detailed simulations are considered that demonstrate the importance of the flexible object oriented construction of QPSchur along with additional features for constraint handling warm starts and partial solution,"['large-scale model predictive control', 'quadratic programming algorithms', 'QPSchur', 'cross directional control problems', 'paper machines', 'object oriented implementation', 'dual space Schur complement algorithm', 'simulations', 'flexible object oriented construction', 'constraint handling', 'warm starts', 'partial solution', 'control system analysis computing', 'large-scale systems', 'object-oriented programming', 'paper industry', 'predictive control', 'quadratic programming']",149,18
849,1009,Robust output feedback model predictive control using off-line linear matrix inequalities A fundamental question about model predictive control MPC is its robustness to model uncertainty. In this paper we present a robust constrained output feedback MPC algorithm that can stabilize plants with both polytopic uncertainty and norm-bound uncertainty. The design procedure involves off-line design of a robust constrained state feedback MPC law and a state estimator using linear matrix inequalities LMIs). Since we employ an off-line approach for the controller design which gives a sequence of explicit control laws we are able to analyze the robust stabilizability of the combined control laws and estimator and by adjusting the design parameters guarantee robust stability of the closed-loop system in the presence of constraints. The algorithm is illustrated with two examples,"['robust output feedback model predictive control', 'off-line linear matrix inequalities', 'model uncertainty robustness', 'robust constrained output feedback MPC algorithm', 'polytopic uncertainty', 'norm-bound uncertainty', 'controller design procedure', 'robust constrained state feedback MPC law', 'state estimator', 'explicit control law sequence', 'closed-loop system', 'asymptotically stable invariant ellipsoid', 'asymptotic stability', 'closed loop systems', 'control system synthesis', 'matrix algebra', 'predictive control', 'robust control', 'state estimation', 'state feedback']",129,20
850,1010,Robust self-tuning PID controller for nonlinear systems In this paper we propose a robust self-tuning PID controller suitable for nonlinear systems. The control system employs a preload relay P_Relay in series with a PID controller. The P_Relay ensures a high gain to yield a robust performance. However it also incurs a chattering phenomenon. In this paper instead of viewing the chattering as an undesirable yet inevitable feature we use it as a naturally occurring signal for tuning and re-tuning the PID controller as the operating regime digresses. No other explicit input signal is required. Once the PID controller is tuned for a particular operating point the relay may be disabled and chattering ceases correspondingly. However it is invoked when there is a change in setpoint to another operating regime. In this way the approach is also applicable to time-varying systems as the PID tuning can be continuous based on the latest set of chattering characteristics. Analysis is provided on the stability properties of the control scheme. Simulation results for the level control of fluid in a spherical tank using the scheme are also presented,"['nonlinear systems', 'robust self-tuning PID controller', 'preload relay', 'robust performance', 'chattering phenomenon', 'naturally occurring signal', 'controller tuning', 'controller re-tuning', 'relay disabling', 'operating regime', 'time-varying systems', 'continuous tuning', 'stability properties', 'simulation results', 'fluid level control', 'spherical tank', 'adaptive control', 'control system analysis', 'level control', 'nonlinear control systems', 'relay control', 'robust control', 'self-adjusting systems', 'stability', 'three-term control', 'time-varying systems']",184,26
851,1011,A self-organizing context-based approach to the tracking of multiple robot trajectories We have combined competitive and Hebbian learning in a neural network designed to learn and recall complex spatiotemporal sequences. In such sequences a particular item may occur more than once or the sequence may share states with another sequence. Processing of repeated/shared states is a hard problem that occurs very often in the domain of robotics. The proposed model consists of two groups of synaptic weights competitive interlayer and Hebbian intralayer connections which are responsible for encoding respectively the spatial and temporal features of the input sequence. Three additional mechanisms allow the network to deal with shared states context units neurons disabled from learning and redundancy used to encode sequence states. The network operates by determining the current and the next state of the learned sequences.

852,1012,Evolving receptive-field controllers for mobile robots The use of evolutionary methods to generate controllers for real-world autonomous agents has attracted attention. Most of the pertinent research has employed genetic algorithms or variations thereof. Research has applied an alternative evolutionary method evolution strategies to the generation of simple Braitenberg vehicles. This application accelerates the development of such controllers by more than an order of magnitude a few hours compared to more than two days). Motivated by this useful speedup the paper investigates the evolution of more complex architectures receptive-field controllers that can employ nonlinear interactions and therefore can yield more complex behavior. It is interesting to note that the evolution strategy yields the same efficacy in terms of function evaluations even though the second class of controllers requires up to 10 times more parameters than the simple Braitenberg architecture. In addition to the speedup there is an important theoretical reason for preferring an evolution strategy over a genetic algorithm for this problem namely the presence of epistasis,"['receptive-field controllers', 'mobile robots', 'evolutionary methods', 'real-world autonomous agents', 'evolution strategies', 'simple Braitenberg vehicles', 'nonlinear interactions', 'complex behavior', 'radial basis functions', 'scalability', 'evolutionary computation', 'mobile robots', 'neurocontrollers']",166,13
853,1013,A scalable intelligent takeoff controller for a simulated running jointed leg Running with jointed legs poses a difficult control problem in robotics. Neural controllers are attractive because they allow the robot to adapt to changing environmental conditions. However scalability is an issue with many neural controllers. The paper describes the development of a scalable neurofuzzy controller for the takeoff phase of the running stride. Scalability is achieved by selecting a controller whose size does not grow with the dimensionality of the problem. Empirical results show that with proper design the takeoff controller scales from a leg with a single movable link to one with three movable links without a corresponding growth in size and without a loss of accuracy,"['scalable intelligent takeoff controller', 'simulated running jointed leg', 'neural controllers', 'changing environmental conditions', 'scalability', 'scalable neurofuzzy controller', 'takeoff phase', 'running stride', 'intelligent robotic control', 'backpropagation', 'cerebellar model arithmetic computers', 'fuzzy control', 'intelligent control', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'legged locomotion', 'neurocontrollers']",119,16
854,1014,Modelling of complete robot dynamics based on a multi-dimensional RBF-like neural architecture A neural network based identification approach of manipulator dynamics is presented. For a structured modelling RBF-like static neural networks are used in order to represent and adapt all model parameters with their non-linear dependences on the joint positions. The neural architecture is hierarchically organised to reach optimal adjustment to structural a priori-knowledge about the identification problem. The model structure is substantially simplified by general system analysis independent of robot type. But also a lot of specific features of the utilised experimental robot are taken into account. A fixed grid based neuron placement together with application of B-spline polynomial basis functions is utilised favourably for a very effective recursive implementation of the neural architecture. Thus an online identification of a dynamic model is submitted for a complete 6 joint industrial robot,"['complete robot dynamics', 'multi-dimensional RBF-like neural architecture', 'manipulator dynamics', 'static neural networks', 'neural architecture', 'general system analysis', 'fixed grid based neuron placement', 'B-spline polynomial basis functions', 'recursive implementation', 'online identification', 'dynamic model', 'complete 6 joint industrial robot', 'online learning', 'identification', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'manipulator dynamics', 'neural net architecture', 'radial basis function networks', 'splines (mathematics)']",142,19
855,1015,Scalable techniques from nonparametric statistics for real time robot learning Locally weighted learning LWL is a class of techniques from nonparametric statistics that provides useful representations and training algorithms for learning about complex phenomena during autonomous adaptive control of robotic systems. The paper introduces several LWL algorithms that have been tested successfully in real-time learning of complex robot tasks. We discuss two major classes of LWL memory-based LWL and purely incremental LWL that does not need to remember any data explicitly. In contrast to the traditional belief that LWL methods cannot work well in high-dimensional spaces we provide new algorithms that have been tested on up to 90 dimensional learning problems. The applicability of our LWL algorithms is demonstrated in various robot learning examples including the learning of devil-sticking pole-balancing by a humanoid robot arm and inverse-dynamics learning for a seven and a 30 degree-of-freedom robot.

856,1016,A scalable model of cerebellar adaptive timing and sequencing the recurrent slide and latch RSL model From the dawn of modern neural network theory the mammalian cerebellum has been a favored object of mathematical modeling studies. Early studies focused on the fanout convergence thresholding and learned weighting of perceptual-motor signals within the cerebellar cortex. This led to the still viable idea that the granule cell stage in the cerebellar cortex performs a sparse expansive recoding of the time-varying input vector. This recoding reveals and emphasizes combinations in a distributed representation that serves as a basis for the learned state-dependent control actions engendered by cerebellar outputs to movement related centers. To make optimal use of available signals the cerebellum must be able to sift the evolving state representation for the most reliable predictors of the need for control actions and to use those predictors even if they appear only transiently and well in advance of the optimal time for initiating the control action. The paper proposes a modification to prior population models for cerebellar adaptive timing and sequencing. Since it replaces a population with a single element the proposed RSL model is in one sense maximally efficient and therefore optimal from the perspective of scalability,"['scalable model', 'cerebellar adaptive timing', 'cerebellar sequencing', 'recurrent slide and latch model', 'neural network theory', 'mammalian cerebellum', 'granule cell stage', 'sparse expansive recoding', 'time-varying input vector', 'distributed representation', 'recurrent network', 'brain models', 'recurrent neural nets', 'timing']",204,14
857,1017,Searching a scalable approach to cerebellar based control Decades of research into the structure and function of the cerebellum have led to a clear understanding of many of its cells as well as how learning might take place. Furthermore there are many theories on what signals the cerebellum operates on and how it works in concert with other parts of the nervous system. Nevertheless the application of computational cerebellar models to the control of robot dynamics remains in its infant state. To date few applications have been realized.

860,1020,Supersampling multiframe blind deconvolution resolution enhancement of adaptive optics compensated imagery of low earth orbit satellites We describe a postprocessing methodology for reconstructing undersampled image sequences with randomly varying blur that can provide image enhancement beyond the sampling resolution of the sensor. This method is demonstrated on simulated imagery and on adaptive-optics-(AO)-compensated imagery taken by the Starfire Optical Range 3.5-m telescope that has been artificially undersampled. Also shown are the results of multiframe blind deconvolution of some of the highest quality optical imagery of low earth orbit satellites collected with a ground-based telescope to date. The algorithm used is a generalization of multiframe blind deconvolution techniques that include a representation of spatial sampling by the focal plane array elements based on a forward stochastic model. This generalization enables the random shifts and shape of the AO-compensated point spread function PSF to be used to partially eliminate the aliasing effects associated with sub-Nyquist sampling of the image by the focal plane array.

862,1022,Bad pixel identification by means of principal components analysis Bad pixels are defined as those pixels showing a temporal evolution of the signal different from the rest of the pixels of a given array. Principal component analysis helps us to understand the definition of a statistical distance associated with each pixels and using this distance it is possible to identify those pixels labeled as bad pixels. The spatiality of a pixel is also calculated. An assumption about the normality of the distribution of the distances of the pixels is revised. Although the influence on the robustness of the identification algorithm is negligible the definition of a parameter related with this nonnormality helps to identify those principal components and eigenimages responsible for the departure from a multinormal distribution.

864,1024,Rational systems exhibit moderate risk aversion with respect to gambles on variable-resolution compression In an embedded wavelet scheme for progressive transmission a tree structure naturally defines the spatial relationship on the hierarchical pyramid. Transform coefficients over each tree correspond to a unique local spatial region of the original image and they can be coded bit-plane by bit-plane through successive-approximation quantization. After receiving the approximate value of some coefficients the decoder can obtain a reconstructed image. We show a rational system for progressive transmission that in absence of a priori knowledge about regions of interest chooses at any truncation time among alternative trees for further transmission in such a way as to avoid certain forms of behavioral inconsistency. We prove that some rational transmission systems might exhibit aversion to risk involving gambles on tree-dependent quality of encoding while others favor taking such risks. Based on an acceptable predictor for visual distinctness from digital imagery we demonstrate that without any outside knowledge risk-prone systems as well as those with strong risk aversion appear in capable of attaining the quality of reconstructions that can be achieved with moderate risk-averse behavior,"['variable-resolution compression', 'progressive transmission', 'rational system', 'moderate risk aversion', 'embedded wavelet scheme', 'tree structure', 'hierarchical pyramid spatial relationship', 'transform coefficients', 'local spatial region', 'successive-approximation quantization', 'reconstructed image', 'truncation time', 'behavioral inconsistency avoidance', 'gambles', 'image encoding', 'acceptable predictor', 'visual distinctness', 'digital imagery', 'embedded coding', 'rate control optimization', 'decision problem', 'progressive transmission utility functions', 'information theoretic measure', 'decision theory', 'decision trees', 'decoding', 'image coding', 'image reconstruction', 'quantisation (signal)', 'wavelet transforms']",187,30
865,1025,Watermarking techniques for electronic delivery of remote sensing images Earth observation missions have recently attracted a growing interest mainly due to the large number of possible applications capable of exploiting remotely sensed data and images. Along with the increase of market potential the need arises for the protection of the image products. Such a need is a very crucial one because the Internet and other public/private networks have become preferred means of data exchange. A critical issue arising when dealing with digital image distribution is copyright protection. Such a problem has been largely addressed by resorting to watermarking technology. A question that obviously arises is whether the requirements imposed by remote sensing imagery are compatible with existing watermarking techniques. On the basis of these motivations the contribution of this work is twofold assessment of the requirements imposed by remote sensing applications on watermark-based copyright protection and modification of two well-established digital watermarking techniques to meet such constraints. More specifically the concept of near-lossless watermarking is introduced and two possible algorithms matching such a requirement are presented. Experimental results are shown to measure the impact of watermark introduction on a typical remote sensing application i.e. unsupervised image classification,"['remote sensing images', 'electronic delivery', 'watermarking techniques', 'Earth observation missions', 'copyright protection', 'digital watermarking', 'near-lossless watermarking', 'digital image distribution', 'unsupervised image classification', 'copy protection', 'image classification', 'image coding', 'remote sensing']",197,13
866,1026,Use of SPOT images as a tool for coastal zone management and monitoring of environmental impacts in the coastal zone Modern techniques such as remote sensing have been one of the main factors leading toward the achievement of serious plans regarding coastal management. A multitemporal analysis of land use in certain areas of the Colombian Caribbean Coast is described. It mainly focuses on environmental impacts caused by anthropogenic activities such as deforestation of mangroves due to shrimp farming. Selection of sensitive areas percentage of destroyed mangroves possible endangered areas etc. are some of the results of this analysis. Recommendations for a coastal management plan in the area have also resulted from this analysis. Some other consequences of the deforestation of mangroves in the coastal zone and the construction of shrimp ponds are also analyzed such as the increase of erosion problems in these areas and water pollution among others. The increase of erosion in these areas has also changed part of their morphology which has been studied by the analysis of SPOT images in previous years. A serious concern exists about the future of these areas. For this reason new techniques like satellite images SPOT have been applied with good results leading to more effective control and coastal management in the area.

867,1027,Extracting straight road structure in urban environments using IKONOS satellite imagery We discuss a fully automatic technique for extracting roads in urban environments. The method has its bases in a vegetation mask derived from multispectral IKONOS data and in texture derived from panchromatic IKONOS data. These two techniques together are used to distinguish road pixels. We then move from individual pixels to an object-based representation that allows reasoning on a higher level. Recognition of individual segments and intersections and the relationships among them are used to determine underlying road structure and to then logically hypothesize the existence of additional road network components.

868,1028,Novel approach to super-resolution pits readout We proposed a novel method to realize the readout of super-resolution pits by using a super-resolution reflective film to replace the reflective layer of the conventional ROM. At the same time by using Sb as the super-resolution reflective layer and SiN as a dielectric layer the super-resolution pits with diameters of 380 nm were read out by a setup whose laser wavelength is 632.8 nm and numerical aperture is 0.40. In addition the influence of the Sb thin film thickness on the readout signal was investigated the results showed that the optimum Sb thin film thickness is 28 to 30 nm and the maximum CNR is 38 to 40 dB,"['super-resolution pits readout', 'super-resolution reflective film', 'Sb super-resolution reflective layer', 'SiN dielectric layer', 'numerical aperture', 'Sb thin film thickness', 'readout signal', 'maximum CNR', '380 nm', '632.8 nm', '28 to 30 nm', 'Sb-SiN', 'antimony', 'optical disc storage', 'optical films', 'optical resolving power', 'silicon compounds']",116,17
869,1029,Effect of insulation layer on transcribability and birefringence distribution in optical disk substrate As the need for information storage media with high storage density increases digital video disks DVDs with smaller recording marks and thinner optical disk substrates than those of conventional DVDs are being required. Therefore improving the replication quality of land-groove or pit structure and reducing the birefringence distribution are emerging as important criteria in the fabrication of high-density optical disk substrates. We control the transcribability and distribution of birefringence by inserting an insulation layer under the stamper during injection-compression molding of DVD RAM substrates. The effects of the insulation layer on the geometrical and optical properties such as transcribability and birefringence distribution are examined experimentally. The inserted insulation layer is found to be very effective in improving the quality of replication and leveling out the first peak of the gapwise birefringence distribution near the mold wall and reducing the average birefringence value because the insulation layer retarded the growth of the solidified layer,"['optical disk substrate', 'transcribability', 'birefringence distribution', 'insulation layer', 'information storage media', 'high storage density', 'digital video disks', 'smaller recording marks', 'thinner optical disk substrates', 'replication quality', 'land-groove', 'pit structure', 'fabrication', 'stamper', 'injection-compression molding', 'DVD RAM substrates', 'geometrical properties', 'optical properties', 'gapwise birefringence distribution', 'mold wall', 'solidified layer growth retardation', 'polyimide thermal insulation layer', 'birefringence', 'moulding', 'optical disc storage', 'optical fabrication', 'replica techniques', 'substrates', 'thermal insulation', 'video discs']",166,30
870,1030,Comparison of automated digital elevation model extraction results using along-track ASTER and across-track SPOT stereo images A digital elevation model DEM can be extracted automatically from stereo satellite images. During the past decade the most common satellite data used to extract DEM was the across-track SPOT. Recently the addition of along-track ASTER data which can be downloaded freely provides another attractive alternative to extract DEM data. This work compares the automated DEM extraction results using an ASTER stereo pair and a SPOT stereo pair over an area of hilly mountains in Drum Mountain Utah when compared to a USGS 7.5-min DEM standard product. The result shows that SPOT produces better DEM results in terms of accuracy and details if the radiometric variations between the images taken on subsequent satellite revolutions are small. Otherwise the ASTER stereo pair is a better choice because of simultaneous along-track acquisition during a single pass. Compared to the USGS 7.5-min DEM the ASTER and the SPOT extracted DEMs have a standard deviation of 11.6 and 4.6 m respectively,"['automated digital elevation model extraction', 'along-track ASTER data', 'across-track SPOT stereo images', 'stereo satellite images', 'ASTER stereo pair', 'SPOT stereo image pair', 'radiometric variations', 'simultaneous along-track acquisition', 'geophysical signal processing', 'height measurement', 'image resolution', 'stereo image processing', 'terrain mapping']",173,13
871,1031,Noise-constrained hyperspectral data compression Storage and transmission requirements for hyperspectral data sets are significant. To reduce hardware costs well-designed compression techniques are needed to preserve information content while maximizing compression ratios. Lossless compression techniques maintain data integrity but yield small compression ratios. We present a slightly lossy compression algorithm that uses the noise statistics of the data to preserve information content while maximizing compression ratios. The adaptive principal components analysis APCA algorithm uses noise statistics to determine the number of significant principal components and selects only those that are required to represent each pixel to within the noise level.

From Lagrange's equations the resulting discretized equations of motion can be simplified as a bilinear system BLS). Introducing the control laws including the quadratic nonlinear and optimal feedback control laws into the BLS it is found that the eddy-current damper can be used to suppress flexible and shear vibrations simultaneously and the system is globally asymptotically stable.

875,1035,H/sub 2 optimization of the three-element type dynamic vibration absorbers The dynamic vibration absorber DVA is a passive vibration control device which is attached to a vibrating body called a primary system subjected to exciting force or motion. In this paper we will discuss an optimization problem of the three-element type DVA on the basis of the H/sub 2 optimization criterion. The objective of the H/sub 2 optimization is to reduce the total vibration energy of the system for overall frequencies the total area under the power spectrum response curve is minimized in this criterion. If the system is subjected to random excitation instead of sinusoidal excitation then the H/sub 2 optimization is probably more desirable than the popular H/sub infinity  optimization. In the past decade there has been increasing interest in the three-element type DVA. However most previous studies on this type of DVA were based on the H/sub infinity  optimization design and no one has been able to find the algebraic solution as of yet. We found a closed-form exact solution for a special case where the primary system has no damping. Furthermore the general case solution including the damped primary system is presented in the form of a numerical solution. The optimum parameters obtained here are compared to those of the conventional Voigt type DVA. They are also compared to other optimum parameters based on the H/sub infinity  criterion,"['H/sub 2/ optimization', 'passive vibration control', 'power spectrum response', 'Voigt type dynamic vibration absorber', 'three-element type dynamic vibration absorbers', 'optimisation', 'vibration control']",232,7
876,1036,Nonlinear control of a shape memory alloy actuated manipulator This paper presents a nonlinear robust control algorithm for accurate positioning of a single degree of freedom rotary manipulator actuated by Shape Memory Alloy SMA). A model for an SMA actuated manipulator is presented. The model includes nonlinear dynamics of the manipulator a constitutive model of Shape Memory Alloy and electrical and heat transfer behavior of SMA wire. This model is used for open and closed loop motion simulations of the manipulator. Experiments are presented that show results similar to both closed and open loop simulation results. Due to modeling uncertainty and nonlinear behavior of the system classic control methods such as Proportional-Integral-Derivative control are not able to present fast and accurate performance. Hence a nonlinear robust control algorithm is presented based on Variable Structure Control. This algorithm is a control gain switching technique based on the weighted average of position and velocity feedbacks. This method has been designed through simulation and tested experimentally. Results show fast accurate and robust performance of the control system.

The design makes use of the method of stochastic averaging to reduce the dimension of the state space and to derive the Ito stochastic differential equation for the response amplitude process. The moment equation of the amplitude process closed by the Rayleigh approximation is used as a means to characterize the transient performance of the feedback control. The steady state and transient response of the amplitude process are used as the design criteria for choosing the feedback control gains.

Fractional differentiation is used to model the viscoelastic behaviour of the suspension. The use of fractional differentiation not only permits optimisation of just four suspension parameters showing the compactness of the fractional derivative operator but also leads to robustness of the suspension's performance to uncertainty of the sprung mass.

The system is first described by a partial differential equation with internal damping. Then the frequency response is analyzed and the three basic characteristics of the flexible system namely average function lower bound and upper bound are defined. On this basis a fractional-order controller is proposed which functions as phase stabilization control for lower frequency and smoothly enters to amplitude stabilization at higher frequency by proper amplitude attenuation.

887,1047,Dynamics and control of initialized fractional-order systems Due to the importance of historical effects in fractional-order systems this paper presents a general fractional-order system and control theory that includes the time-varying initialization response. Previous studies have not properly accounted for these historical effects. The initialization response along with the forced response for fractional-order systems is determined. The scalar fractional-order impulse response is determined and is a generalization of the exponential function. Stability properties of fractional-order systems are presented in the complex w-plane which is a transformation of the s-plane. Time responses are discussed with respect to pole positions in the complex w-plane and frequency response behavior is included. A fractional-order vector space representation which is a generalization of the state space concept is presented including the initialization response.

888,1048,Parallel and distributed Haskells Parallel and distributed languages specify computations on multiple processors and have a computation language to describe the algorithm i.e. what to compute and a coordination language to describe how to organise the computations across the processors. Haskell has been used as the computation language for a wide variety of parallel and distributed languages and this paper is a comprehensive survey of implemented languages. It outlines parallel and distributed language concepts and classifies Haskell extensions using them. Similar example programs are used to illustrate and contrast the coordination languages and the comparison is facilitated by the common computation language.

889,1049,A typed representation for HTML and XML documents in Haskell We define a family of embedded domain specific languages for generating HTML and XML documents. Each language is implemented as a combinator library in Haskell. The generated HTML/XML documents are guaranteed to be well-formed. In addition each library can guarantee that the generated documents are valid XML documents to a certain extent for HTML only a weaker guarantee is possible). On top of the libraries Haskell serves as a meta language to define parameterized documents to map structured documents to HTML/XML to define conditional content or to define entire Web sites.

890,1050,Secrets of the Glasgow Haskell compiler inliner Higher-order languages such as Haskell encourage the programmer to build abstractions by composing functions. A good compiler must inline many of these calls to recover an efficiently executable program. In principle inlining is dead simple just replace the call of a function by an instance of its body. But any compiler-writer will tell you that inlining is a black art full of delicate compromises that work together to give good performance without unnecessary code bloat. The purpose of this paper is therefore to articulate the key lessons we learned from a full-scale production inliner the one used in the Glasgow Haskell compiler. We focus mainly on the algorithmic aspects but we also provide some indicative measurements to substantiate the importance of various aspects of the inliner,"['Glasgow Haskell compiler inliner', 'higher-order languages', 'functional programming', 'abstractions', 'executable program', 'performance', 'algorithmic aspects', 'functional language', 'optimising compiler', 'functional languages', 'functional programming', 'optimising compilers']",133,12
891,1051,Faking it simulating dependent types in Haskell Dependent types reflect the fact that validity of data is often a relative notion by allowing prior data to affect the types of subsequent data. Not only does this make for a precise type system but also a highly generic one both the type and the program for each instance of a family of operations can be computed from the data which codes for that instance. Recent experimental extensions to the Haskell type class mechanism give us strong tools to relativize types to other types. We may simulate some aspects of dependent typing by making counterfeit type-level copies of data with type constructors simulating data constructors and type classes simulating datatypes.

893,1053,A static semantics for Haskell This paper gives a static semantics for Haskell 98 a non-strict purely functional programming language. The semantics formally specifies nearly all the details of the Haskell 98 type system including the resolution of overloading kind inference including defaulting and polymorphic recursion the only major omission being a proper treatment of ambiguous overloading and its resolution. Overloading is translated into explicit dictionary passing as in all current implementations of Haskell. The target language of this translation is a variant of the Girard-Reynolds polymorphic lambda calculus featuring higher order polymorphism. and explicit type abstraction and application in the term language. Translated programs can thus still be type checked although the implicit version of this system is impredicative. A surprising result of this formalization effort is that the monomorphism restriction when rendered in a system of inference rules compromises the principal type property,"['static semantics', 'Haskell 98', 'nonstrict purely functional programming language', 'formal specification', 'type system', 'overloading', 'kind inference', 'polymorphic recursion', 'explicit dictionary passing', 'polymorphic lambda calculus', 'higher order polymorphism', 'explicit type abstraction', 'term language', 'type checking', 'monomorphism restriction', 'inference rules', 'functional languages', 'lambda calculus', 'programming language semantics']",145,19
894,1054,Choice preferences without inferences subconscious priming of risk attitudes We present a procedure for subconscious priming of risk attitudes. In Experiment 1 we were reliably able to induce risk-seeking or risk-averse preferences across a range of decision scenarios using this priming procedure. In Experiment 2 we showed that these priming effects can be reversed by drawing participants attention to the priming event. Our results support claims that the formation of risk preferences can be based on preconscious processing as for example postulated by the affective primacy hypothesis rather than rely on deliberative mental operations as posited by several current models of judgment and decision making,"['subconscious priming', 'risk attitudes', 'risk-seeking preferences', 'risk-averse preferences', 'decision scenarios', 'preconscious processing', 'affective primacy hypothesis', 'deliberative mental operations', 'choice preferences', 'decision theory', 'psychology']",105,11
895,1055,A re-examination of probability matching and rational choice In a typical probability learning task participants are presented with a repeated choice between two response alternatives one of which has a higher payoff probability than the other. Rational choice theory requires that participants should eventually allocate all their responses to the high-payoff alternative but previous research has found that people fail to maximize their payoffs. Instead it is commonly observed that people match their response probabilities to the payoff probabilities. We report three experiments on this choice anomaly using a simple probability learning task in which participants were provided with i large financial incentives ii meaningful and regular feedback and iii extensive training. In each experiment large proportions of participants adopted the optimal response strategy and all three of the factors mentioned above contributed to this. The results are supportive of rational choice theory,"['probability learning task', 'rational choice theory', 'probability matching', 'payoff probability', 'response probabilities', 'choice anomaly', 'large financial incentives', 'meaningful regular feedback', 'extensive training', 'optimal response strategy', 'feedback', 'rationality', 'decision theory', 'feedback', 'probability', 'psychology']",143,16
896,1056,Eliminating recency with self-review the case of auditors going concern judgments This paper examines the use of self-review to debias recency. Recency is found in the going concern judgments of staff auditors but is successfully eliminated by the auditor's use of a simple self-review technique that would be extremely easy to implement in audit practice. Auditors who self-review are also less inclined to make audit report choices that are inconsistent with their going concern judgments. These results are important because the judgments of staff auditors often determine the type and extent of documentation in audit workpapers and serve as preliminary inputs for senior auditors judgments and choices. If staff auditors judgments are affected by recency the impact of this bias may be impounded in the ultimate judgments and choices of senior auditors. Since biased judgments can expose auditors to significant costs involving extended audit procedures legal liability and diminished reputation simple debiasing techniques that reduce this exposure are valuable. The paper also explores some future research needs and other important issues concerning judgment debiasing in applied professional settings,"['auditor going concern judgments', 'recency debiasing', 'self-review', 'staff auditors', 'audit report choices', 'documentation', 'audit workpapers', 'senior auditors', 'extended audit procedures', 'legal liability', 'diminished reputation', 'judgment debiasing', 'applied professional settings', 'accountability', 'probability judgments', 'auditing', 'behavioural sciences', 'decision theory', 'probability']",178,19
897,1057,Acceptance of a price discount the role of the semantic relatedness between purchases and the comparative price format Two studies are reported where people are asked to accept or not a price reduction on a target product. In the high low relative saving version the regular price of the target product is low high). In both versions the absolute value of the price reduction is the same as well as the total of regular prices of planned purchases. As first reported by Tversky and Kahneman 1981 findings show that the majority of people accept the price discount in the high-relative saving version whereas the minority do it in the low one. In Study 1 findings show that the previous preference reversal disappears when planned purchases are strongly related. Also a previously unreported preference reversal is found. The majority of people accept the price discount when the products are weakly related whereas the minority accept when the products are strongly related. In Study 2 findings show that the classic preference reversal disappears as a function of the comparative price format. Also another previously unreported preference reversal is found. When the offered price reduction relates to a low-priced product people are more inclined to accept it with a control than a minimal comparative price format.

A preference for larger stimuli was found on the majority of trials using various types of stimuli stimuli of various sizes and with both adult and 3-year-old participants.

899,1059,Mustering motivation to enact decisions how decision process characteristics influence goal realization Decision scientists tend to focus mainly on decision antecedents studying how people make decisions.

900,1060,Variety identification of wheat using mass spectrometry with neural networks and the influence of mass spectra processing prior to neural network analysis The performance of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry with neural networks in wheat variety classification is further evaluated. Two principal issues were studied a the number of varieties that could be classified correctly and b various means of preprocessing mass spectrometric data. The number of wheat varieties tested was increased from 10 to 30. The main pre-processing method investigated was based on Gaussian smoothing of the spectra but other methods based on normalisation procedures and multiplicative scatter correction of data were also used. With the final method it was possible to classify 30 wheat varieties with 87 correctly classified mass spectra and a correlation coefficient of 0.90,"['matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry', 'wheat variety classification', 'mass spectrometric data', 'pre-processing- method', 'Gaussian smoothing', 'normalisation procedures', 'multiplicative scatter correction', 'correctly classified mass spectra', 'correlation coefficient', 'variety identification', 'mass spectra processing', 'neural network analysis', 'agriculture', 'biological techniques', 'biology computing', 'botany', 'data analysis', 'Gaussian processes', 'ionisation', 'laser beam applications', 'neural nets', 'spectral analysis', 'spectroscopy computing', 'thermally stimulated desorption', 'time of flight mass spectra']",130,25

902,1062,Fidelity of quantum teleportation through noisy channels We investigate quantum teleportation through noisy quantum channels by solving analytically and numerically a master equation in the Lindblad form. We calculate the fidelity as a function of decoherence rates and angles of a state to be teleported. It is found that the average fidelity and the range of states to be accurately teleported depend on types of noises acting on quantum channels. If the quantum channels are subject to isotropic noise the average fidelity decays to 1/2 which is smaller than the best possible value of 2/3 obtained only by the classical communication. On the other hand if the noisy quantum channel is modeled by a single Lindblad operator the average fidelity is always greater than 2/3,"['fidelity', 'quantum teleportation', 'noisy quantum channels', 'analytical solution', 'numerical solution', 'quantum channels', 'classical communication', 'Lindblad operator', 'Alice', 'Bob', 'sender', 'recipient', 'dual classical channels', 'eigenstate', 'isotropic noise', 'quantum communication']",125,16
903,1063,Operations that do not disturb partially known quantum states Consider a situation in which a quantum system is secretly prepared in a state chosen from the known set of states. We present a principle that gives a definite distinction between the operations that preserve the states of the system and those that disturb the states. The principle is derived by alternately applying a fundamental property of classical signals and a fundamental property of quantum ones. The principle can be cast into a simple form by using a decomposition of the relevant Hilbert space which is uniquely determined by the set of possible states. The decomposition implies the classification of the degrees of freedom of the system into three parts depending on how they store the information on the initially chosen state one storing it classically one storing it nonclassically and the other one storing no information. Then the principle states that the nonclassical part is inaccessible and the classical part is read-only if we are to preserve the state of the system. From this principle many types of no-cloning no-broadcasting and no-imprinting conditions can easily be derived in general forms including mixed states. It also gives a unified view on how various schemes of quantum cryptography work. The principle helps one to derive optimum amount of resources bits qubits and ebits required in data compression or in quantum teleportation of mixed-state ensembles,"['partially known quantum states', 'quantum system', 'secretly prepared quantum state', 'classical signals', 'Hilbert space', 'degrees of freedom', 'nonclassical part', 'quantum cryptography', 'bits', 'qubits', 'ebits', 'quantum teleportation', 'mixed-state ensembles', 'Hilbert spaces', 'quantum communication', 'quantum cryptography', 'quantum theory']",232,17

In particular we study a situation when the programmable measurement device serves for the unambiguous discrimination between nonorthogonal states. The particular pair of states that can be unambiguously discriminated is specified by the state of a program qubit.

906,1066,Application of artificial intelligence to search ground-state geometry of clusters We introduce a global optimization procedure the neural-assisted genetic algorithm NAGA). It combines the power of an artificial neural network ANN with the versatility of the genetic algorithm. This method is suitable to solve optimization problems that depend on some kind of heuristics to limit the search space. If a reasonable amount of data is available the ANN can understand the problem and provide the genetic algorithm with a selected population of elements that will speed up the search for the optimum solution. We tested the method in a search for the ground-state geometry of silicon clusters. We trained the ANN with information about the geometry and energetics of small silicon clusters. Next the ANN learned how to restrict the configurational space for larger silicon clusters. For Si/sub 10 and Si/sub 20 we noticed that the NAGA is at least three times faster than the pure genetic algorithm. As the size of the cluster increases it is expected that the gain in terms of time will increase as well,"['artificial intelligence', 'ground-state geometry', 'atomic clusters', 'global optimization procedure', 'neural-assisted genetic algorithm', 'artificial neural network', 'population', 'optimum solution', 'silicon clusters', 'Si/sub 10/', 'Si/sub 20/', 'cluster size', 'artificial intelligence', 'atomic clusters', 'genetic algorithms', 'ground states', 'molecular configurations', 'neural nets', 'optimisation', 'physics computing']",179,20
907,1067,Quantum-information processing by nuclear magnetic resonance Experimental implementation of half-adder and subtractor operations using an oriented spin-7/2 system The advantages of using quantum systems for performing many computational tasks have already been established. Several quantum algorithms have been developed which exploit the inherent property of quantum systems such as superposition of states and entanglement for efficiently performing certain tasks. The experimental implementation has been achieved on many quantum systems of which nuclear magnetic resonance has shown the largest progress in terms of number of qubits. This paper describes the use of a spin-7/2 as a three-qubit system and experimentally implements the half-adder and subtractor operations. The required qubits are realized by partially orienting sup 133/Cs nuclei in a liquid-crystalline medium yielding a quadrupolar split well-resolved septet.

913,1073,Quantum retrodiction in open systems Quantum retrodiction involves finding the probabilities for various preparation events given a measurement event. This theory has been studied for some time but mainly as an interesting concept associated with time asymmetry in quantum mechanics. Recent interest in quantum communications and cryptography however has provided retrodiction with a potential practical application. For this purpose quantum retrodiction in open systems should be more relevant than in closed systems isolated from the environment. In this paper we study retrodiction in open systems and develop a general master equation for the backward time evolution of the measured state which can be used for calculating preparation probabilities. We solve the master equation by way of example for the driven two-level atom coupled to the electromagnetic field,"['quantum retrodiction', 'probabilities', 'preparation events', 'measurement event', 'time asymmetry', 'quantum mechanics', 'quantum communications', 'cryptography', 'retrodictive master equation', 'backward time evolution', 'preparation probabilities', 'driven two level atom-electromagnetic field coupling', 'open systems', 'atom-photon collisions', 'electromagnetic fields', 'master equation', 'open systems', 'probability', 'quantum communication', 'quantum theory']",127,20

917,1077,Quantum learning and universal quantum matching machine Suppose that three kinds of quantum systems are given in some unknown states |f>/sup X)N |g/sub 1/>/sup X)K and |g/sub 2/>/sup X)K and we want to decide which template state |g/sub 1 or |g/sub 2 each representing the feature of the pattern class C/sub 1 or C/sub 2 respectively is closest to the input feature state |f>. This is an extension of the pattern matching problem into the quantum domain. Assuming that these states are known a priori to belong to a certain parametric family of pure qubit systems we derive two kinds of matching strategies. The first one is a semiclassical strategy that is obtained by the natural extension of conventional matching strategies and consists of a two-stage procedure identification estimation of the unknown template states to design the classifier learning process to train the classifier and classification of the input system into the appropriate pattern class based on the estimated results. The other is a fully quantum strategy without any intermediate measurement which we might call as the universal quantum matching machine. We present the Bayes optimal solutions for both strategies in the case of K=1 showing that there certainly exists a fully quantum matching procedure that is strictly superior to the straightforward semiclassical extension of the conventional matching strategy based on the learning process,"['quantum learning', 'universal quantum matching machine', 'pattern class', 'pattern matching problem', 'quantum domain', 'qubit systems', 'matching strategies', 'semiclassical strategy', 'two-stage procedure', 'quantum strategy', 'Bayes optimal solutions', 'quantum matching procedure', 'semiclassical extension', 'matching strategy', 'learning process', 'learning systems', 'quantum theory']",224,17

We work in an abstract Banach space setting assuming that A is the generator of an analytic semigroup and that B is relatively bounded with respect to A. Since W-methods treat the term with A implicitly whereas the term involving B is discretized in an explicit way they can be regarded as splitting methods.

922,1082,Numerical approximation of nonlinear BVPs by means of BVMs Boundary Value Methods BVMs would seem to be suitable candidates for the solution of nonlinear Boundary Value Problems BVPs). They have been successfully used for solving linear BVPs together with a mesh selection strategy based on the conditioning of the linear systems. Our aim is to extend this approach so as to use them for the numerical approximation of nonlinear problems. For this reason we consider the quasi-linearization technique that is an application of the Newton method to the nonlinear differential equation. Consequently each iteration requires the solution of a linear BVP. In order to guarantee the convergence to the solution of the continuous nonlinear problem it is necessary to determine how accurately the linear BVPs must be solved. For this goal suitable stopping criteria on the residual and on the error for each linear BVP are given. Numerical experiments on stiff problems give rather satisfactory results showing that the experimental code called TOM that uses a class of BVMs and the quasi-linearization technique may be competitive with well known solvers for BVPs,"['numerical approximation', 'nonlinear boundary value problems', 'boundary value methods', 'mesh selection strategy', 'quasi-linearization technique', 'Newton method', 'nonlinear differential equation', 'stopping criteria', 'stiff problems', 'BVMs', 'boundary-value problems', 'Newton method', 'nonlinear differential equations']",182,13
923,1083,Differential algebraic systems anew It is proposed to figure out the leading term in differential algebraic systems more precisely. Low index linear systems with those properly stated leading terms are considered in detail. In particular it is asked whether a numerical integration method applied to the original system reaches the inherent regular ODE without conservation i.e. whether the discretization and the decoupling commute in some sense. In general one cannot expect this commutativity so that additional difficulties like strong stepsize restrictions may arise. Moreover abstract differential algebraic equations in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are introduced and the index notion is generalized to those equations. In particular partial differential algebraic equations are considered in this abstract formulation,"['differential algebraic systems', 'low index linear systems', 'numerical integration method', 'inherent regular ODE', 'commutativity', 'stepsize restrictions', 'abstract differential algebraic equations', 'differential equations', 'matrix algebra', 'stability']",115,10

928,1088,Parallel implicit predictor corrector methods The performance of parallel codes for the solution of initial value problems is usually strongly sensitive to the dimension of the continuous problem. This is due to the overhead related to the exchange of information among the processors and motivates the problem of minimizing the amount of communications. According to this principle we define the so called Parallel Implicit Predictor Corrector Methods and in this class we derive A-stable L-stable and numerically zero-stable formulas. The latter property refers to the zero-stability condition of a given formula when roundoff errors are introduced in its coefficients due to their representation in finite precision arithmetic.

931,1091,Car-caravan snaking. 1. The influence of pintle pin friction A brief review of knowledge of car-caravan snaking is carried out. Against the background described a fairly detailed mathematical model of a contemporary car-trailer system is constructed and a baseline set of parameter values is given. In reduced form the model is shown to give results in accordance with literature. The properties of the baseline combination are explored using both linear and non-linear versions of the model. The influences of damping at the pintle joint and of several other design parameters on the stability of the linear system in the neighbourhood of the critical snaking speed are calculated and discussed. Coulomb friction damping at the pintle pin is then included and simulations are used to indicate the consequent amplitude-dependent behaviour. The friction damping especially when its level has to be chosen by the user is shown to give dangerous characteristics despite having some capacity for stabilization of the snaking motions. It is concluded that pintle pin friction damping does not represent a satisfactory solution to the snaking problem.

932,1092,Ride quality evaluation of an actively-controlled stretcher for an ambulance This study considers the subjective evaluation of ride quality during ambulance transportation using an actively-controlled stretcher ACS). The ride quality of a conventional stretcher and an assistant driver's seat is also compared. Braking during ambulance transportation generates negative foot-to-head acceleration in patients and causes blood pressure to rise in the patient's head. The ACS absorbs the foot-to-head acceleration by changing the angle of the stretcher thus reducing the blood pressure variation. However the ride quality of the ACS should be investigated further because the movement of the ACS may cause motion sickness and nausea. Experiments of ambulance transportation including rapid acceleration and deceleration are performed to evaluate the effect of differences in posture of the transported subject on the ride quality the semantic differential method and factor analysis are used in the investigations. Subjects are transported using a conventional stretcher with head forward a conventional stretcher with head backward the ACS and an assistant driver's seat for comparison with transportation using a stretcher. Experimental results show that the ACS gives the most comfortable transportation when using a stretcher. Moreover the reduction of the negative foot-to-head acceleration at frequencies below 0.2 Hz and the small variation of the foot-to-head acceleration result in more comfortable transportation. Conventional transportation with the head forward causes the worst transportation although the characteristics of the vibration of the conventional stretcher seem to be superior to that of the ACS,"['actively-controlled stretcher', 'ambulance', 'ride quality evaluation', 'subjective evaluation', 'ambulance transportation', 'conventional stretcher', 'assistant driver seat', 'braking', 'negative foot-to-head acceleration', 'blood pressure variation', 'patient head', 'stretcher angle', 'motion sickness', 'nausea', 'rapid acceleration', 'rapid deceleration', 'posture differences', 'transported subject', 'semantic differential method', 'factor analysis', 'head forward', 'head backward', 'comfortable transportation', 'vibration', 'braking', 'haemodynamics', 'patient care', 'position control', 'road vehicles']",243,29
933,1093,A fuzzy logic approach to accommodate thermal stress and improve the start-up phase in combined cycle power plants Use of combined cycle power generation plant has increased dramatically over the last decade. A supervisory control approach based on a dynamic model is developed which makes use of proportional-integral-derivative PID fuzzy logic and fuzzy PID schemes. The aim is to minimize the steam turbine plant start-up time without violating maximum thermal stress limits.

935,1095,Development of a real-time monitoring system This paper describes a pattern recognition PR technique which uses learning vector quantization LVQ). This method is adapted for practical application to solve problems in the area of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis where a number of fault signatures are involved. In these situations the aim is health monitoring including identification of deterioration of the healthy condition and identification of causes of the failure in real-time. For this reason a fault database is developed which contains the collected information about various states of operation of the system in the form of pattern vectors. The task of the real-time monitoring system is to correlate patterns of unknown faults with the known fault signatures in the fault database. This will determine cause of failure and degree of deterioration of the system under test. The problem of fault diagnosis may involve a large number of patterns and large sampling time which affects the learning stage of neural networks. The study here also aims to find a fast learning model of neural networks for instances when a high number of patterns and numerous processing elements are involved. It begins searching for an appropriate solution. The study is extended to the enforcement learning models and considers LVQ as a network emerged from the competitive learning model through enforcement training.

This experimental work was carried out to compare the performance of alternative control strategies in various manufacturing environments and to investigate the relationship between the control and controlled systems. The experimental test-bed presented in this paper consists of an agent-based control system implemented in C++ and a discrete-event simulation model. Using this test-bed various control strategies were tested on a benchmark manufacturing system by varying production volumes to model the production system with looser/tighter schedules and disturbance frequencies.

937,1097,A study on an automatic seam tracking system by using an electromagnetic sensor for sheet metal arc welding of butt joints Many sensors such as the vision sensor and the laser displacement sensor have been developed to automate the arc welding process. However these sensors have some problems due to the effects of arc light fumes and spatter. An electromagnetic sensor which utilizes the generation of an eddy current was developed for detecting the weld line of a butt joint in which the root gap size was zero.

938,1098,Instability phenomena in the gas-metal arc welding self-regulation process Arc instability is a very important determinant of weld quality. The instability behaviour of the gas-metal arc welding GMAW process is characterized by strong oscillations in arc length and current. In the paper a model of the GMAW process is developed using an exact arc voltage characteristic. This model is used to study stability of the self-regulation process and to develop a simulation program that helps to understand the transient or dynamic nature of the GMAW process and relationships among current electrode extension and contact tube-work distance. The process is shown to exhibit instabilities at both long electrode extension and normal extension. Results obtained from simulation runs of the model were also experimentally confirmed by the present author as reported in this study. In order to explain the concept of the instability phenomena the metal transfer mode and the arc voltage-current characteristic were examined. Based on this examination the conclusion of this study is that their combined effects lead to the oscillations in arc current and length,"['instability phenomena', 'gas-metal arc welding', 'self-regulation process', 'arc instability', 'weld quality', 'GMAW process', 'exact arc voltage characteristic', 'metal transfer mode', 'adaptive control', 'arc welding', 'process control', 'self-adjusting systems', 'stability']",176,13
939,1099,WebCAD A computer aided design tool constrained with explicit design for manufacturability rules for computer numerical control milling A key element in the overall efficiency of a manufacturing enterprise is the compatibility between the features that have been created in a newly designed part and the capabilities of the downstream manufacturing processes. With this in mind a process-aware computer aided design CAD system called WebCAD has been developed. The system restricts the freedom of the designer in such a way that the designed parts can be manufactured on a three-axis computer numerical control milling machine. This paper discusses the vision of WebCAD and explains the rationale for its development in comparison with commercial CAD/CAM computer aided design/manufacture systems.

940,1100,Evaluation of existing and new feature recognition algorithms. 2. Experimental results For pt.1 see ibid. p.839-851. This is the second of two papers investigating the performance of general-purpose feature detection techniques. The first paper describes the development of a methodology to synthesize possible general feature detection face sets. Six algorithms resulting from the synthesis have been designed and implemented on a SUN Workstation in C++ using ACIS as the geometric modelling system. In this paper extensive tests and comparative analysis are conducted on the feature detection algorithms using carefully selected components from the public domain mostly from the National Design Repository. The results show that the new and enhanced algorithms identify face sets that previously published algorithms cannot detect. The tests also show that each algorithm can detect among other types a certain type of feature that is unique to it. Hence most of the algorithms discussed in this paper would have to be combined to obtain complete coverage,"['feature recognition algorithms', 'general-purpose feature detection techniques', 'National Design Repository', 'face sets', 'convex hull', 'concavity', 'feature extraction', 'mechanical engineering']",159,8

942,1102,Design and implementation of a reusable and extensible HL7 encoding/decoding framework The Health Level Seven HL7 an international standard for electronic data exchange in all health care environments enables disparate computer applications to exchange key sets of clinical and administrative information. Above all it defines the standard HL7 message formats prescribed by the standard encoding rules. In this paper we propose a flexible reusable and extensible HL7 encoding and decoding framework using a message object model MOM and message definition repository MDR). The MOM provides an abstract HL7 message form represented by a group of objects and their relationships. It reflects logical relationships among the standard HL7 message elements such as segments fields and components while enforcing the key structural constraints imposed by the standard. Since the MOM completely eliminates the dependency of the HL7 encoder and decoder on platform-specific data formats it makes it possible to build the encoder and decoder as reusable standalone software components enabling the interconnection of arbitrary heterogeneous hospital information systems HIS with little effort. Moreover the MDR an external database of key definitions for HL7 messages helps make the encoder and decoder as resilient as possible to future modifications of the standard HL7 message formats. It is also used by the encoder and decoder to perform a well-formedness check for their respective inputs i.e. HL7 message objects expressed in the MOM and encoded HL7 message strings). Although we implemented a prototype version of the encoder and decoder using JAVA they can be easily packaged and delivered as standalone components using the standard component frameworks,"['reusable framework', 'extensible encoding/decoding framework', 'Health Level Seven', 'message object model', 'message definition repository', 'MDR', 'MOM', 'abstract message form', 'logical relationships', 'structural constraints', 'international standard', 'standalone software components', 'heterogeneous hospital information systems', 'HIS', 'external database', 'key definitions', 'JAVA', 'ActiveX', 'JAVABEAN', 'CORBA', 'electronic data exchange', 'health care environments', 'clinical information', 'administrative information', 'HL7 message formats', 'decoding', 'distributed object management', 'electronic data interchange', 'encoding', 'file organisation', 'health care', 'Java', 'medical information systems', 'message passing', 'software reusability', 'software standards']",260,36

The study of the hardware structure of the multi-view image processing has not been accomplished. The proposed multi-view images decoder operates in a three stage pipelined manner and extracts the depth of the pixels of the decoded image every clock. The multi-view images decoder consists of three modules Node selector which transfers the value of the nodes repeatedly and Depth Extractor which extracts the depth of each pixel from the four values of the nodes and Affine Transformer which generates the projecting position on the image plane from the values of the pixels and the specified viewpoint.

947,1107,A knowledge-navigation system for dimensional metrology Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing GD&T is a method to specify the dimensions and form of a part so that it will meet its design intent. GD&T is difficult to master for two main reasons. First it is based on complex 3D geometric entities and relationships. Second the geometry is associated with a large diverse knowledge base of dimensional metrology with many interconnections. This paper describes an approach to create a dimensional metrology knowledge base that is organized around a set of key concepts and to represent those concepts as virtual objects that can be navigated with interactive computer visualization techniques to access the associated knowledge. The approach can enable several applications. First is the application to convey the definition and meaning of GD&T over a broad range of tolerance types. Second is the application to provide a visualization of dimensional metrology knowledge within a control hierarchy of the inspection process.

By attaching a density function to each particle as its attribute the diffusion of smoke can be described by the variation of particles density functions along with the effect on airflow by controlling particles movement and fragmentation. In addition a continuous density field for realistic rendering can be generated quickly through the look-up tables of particle's density functions. Compared with traditional particle systems this approach can describe smoke diffusion and provide a continuous density field for realistic rendering with much less computation. A quick rendering scheme is also presented in this paper as a useful preview tool for tuning appropriate parameters in the smoke model,"['hybrid model', 'smoke simulation', 'density functions', 'continuous density field', 'rendering', 'look-up tables', 'rendering (computer graphics)', 'table lookup']",131,8

952,1112,Blending parametric patches with subdivision surfaces In this paper the problem of blending parametric surfaces using subdivision patches is discussed. A new approach named removing-boundary is presented to generate piecewise-smooth subdivision surfaces through discarding the outmost quadrilaterals of the open meshes derived by each subdivision step. Then the approach is employed both to blend parametric bicubic B-spline surfaces and to fill n-sided holes. It is easy to produce piecewise-smooth subdivision surfaces with both convex and concave corners on the boundary and limit surfaces are guaranteed to be C/sup 2 continuous on the boundaries except for a few singular points by the removing-boundary approach. Thus the blending method is very efficient and the blending surface generated is of good effect,"['subdivision surfaces', 'parametric surfaces blending', 'subdivision patches', 'piecewise-smooth subdivision surfaces', 'quadrilaterals', 'parametric bicubic B-spline surfaces', 'piecewise smooth subdivision surfaces', 'computer graphics', 'solid modelling', 'splines (mathematics)']",119,10

Wavelet representations have been used in a broad range of applications including image compression physical simulation and numerical analysis. In this paper the authors construct a new class of wavelets called four-point wavelets based on an interpolatory four-point subdivision scheme. They are of local support symmetric and stable. The analysis and synthesis algorithms have linear time complexity. Depending on different weight parameters w the scaling functions and wavelets generated by the four-point subdivision scheme are of different degrees of smoothness.

957,1117,An attack-finding algorithm for security protocols This paper proposes an automatic attack construction algorithm in order to find potential attacks on security protocols. It is based on a dynamic strand space model which enhances the original strand space model by introducing active nodes on strands so as to characterize the dynamic procedure of protocol execution. With exact causal dependency relations between messages considered in the model this algorithm can avoid state space explosion caused by asynchronous composition. In order to get a finite state space a new method called strand-added on demand is exploited which extends a bundle in an incremental manner without requiring explicit configuration of protocol execution parameters. A finer granularity model of term structure is also introduced in which subterms are divided into check subterms and data subterms. Moreover data subterms can be further classified based on the compatible data subterm relation to obtain automatically the finite set of valid acceptable terms for an honest principal. In this algorithm terms core is designed to represent the intruder's knowledge compactly and forward search technology is used to simulate attack patterns easily. Using this algorithm a new attack on the Dolve-Yao protocol can be found which is even more harmful because the secret is revealed before the session terminates,"['attack-finding algorithm', 'security protocols', 'dynamic strand space model', 'strand space model', 'state space explosion', 'asynchronous composition', 'strand-added on demand', 'check subterms', 'data subterms', 'Dolve-Yao protocol', 'data structures', 'protocols', 'security of data']",210,13
958,1118,Run-time data-flow analysis Parallelizing compilers have made great progress in recent years. However there still remains a gap between the current ability of parallelizing compilers and their final goals. In order to achieve the maximum parallelism run-time techniques were used in parallelizing compilers during last few years. First this paper presents a basic run-time privatization method. The definition of run-time dead code is given and its side effect is discussed. To eliminate the imprecision caused by the run-time dead code backward data-flow information must be used. Proteus Test which can use backward information in run-time is then presented to exploit more dynamic parallelism. Also a variation of Proteus Test the Advanced Proteus Test is offered to achieve partial parallelism. Proteus Test was implemented on the parallelizing compiler AFT.

960,1120,An effective feedback control mechanism for DiffServ architecture As a scalable QoS Quality of Service architecture Diffserv Differentiated Service mainly consists of two components traffic conditioning at the edge of the Diffserv domain and simple packet forwarding inside the DiffServ domain. DiffServ has many advantages such as flexibility scalability and simplicity. But when providing AF Assured Forwarding services DiffServ has some problems such as unfairness among aggregated flows or among micro-flows belonging to an aggregated flow. In this paper a feedback mechanism for AF aggregated flows is proposed to solve this problem. Simulation results show that this mechanism does improve the performance of DiffServ. First it can improve the fairness among aggregated flows and make DiffServ more friendly toward TCP Transmission Control Protocol flows.

961,1121,Optimal bandwidth utilization of all-optical ring with a converter of degree 4 In many models of all-optical routing a set of communication paths in a network is given and a wavelength is to be assigned to each path so that paths sharing an edge receive different wavelengths. The goal is to assign as few wavelengths as possible in order to use the optical bandwidth efficiently. If a node of a network contains a wavelength converter any path that passes through this node may change its wavelength. Having converters at some of the nodes can reduce the number of wavelengths required for routing. This paper presents a wavelength converter with degree 4 and gives a routing algorithm which shows that any routing with load L can be realized with L wavelengths when a node of an all-optical ring hosts such a wavelength converter. It is also proved that 4 is the minimum degree of the converter to reach the full utilization of the available wavelengths if only one node of an all-optical ring hosts a converter,"['all-optical routing', 'communication paths', 'all-optical network', 'wavelength assignment', 'wavelength translation', 'wavelength converter', 'all-optical ring', 'optical fibre networks', 'telecommunication network routing', 'wavelength division multiplexing']",175,10
962,1122,Hybrid broadcast for the video-on-demand service Multicast offers an efficient means of distributing video contents/programs to multiple clients by batching their requests and then having them share a server's video stream. Batching customers requests is either client-initiated or server-initiated. Most advanced client-initiated video multicasts are implemented by patching. Periodic broadcast a typical server-initiated approach can be entirety-based or segment-based. This paper focuses on the performance of the VoD service for popular videos. First we analyze the limitation of conventional patching when the customer request rate is high. Then by combining the advantages of each of the two broadcast schemes we propose a hybrid broadcast scheme for popular videos which not only lowers the service latency but also improves clients interactivity by using an active buffering technique. This is shown to be a good compromise for both lowering service latency and improving the VCR-like interactivity,"['quality-of-service', 'interactivity', 'scheduling', 'video-on-demand', 'multicast', 'conventional patching', 'customer request rate', 'hybrid broadcast scheme', 'multicast communication', 'quality of service', 'video on demand']",144,11
963,1123,A transactional asynchronous replication scheme for mobile database systems In mobile database systems mobility of users has a significant impact on data replication. As a result the various replica control protocols that exist today in traditional distributed and multidatabase environments are no longer suitable. To solve this problem a new mobile database replication scheme the Transaction-Level Result-Set Propagation TLRSP model is put forward in this paper. The conflict detection and resolution strategy based on TLRSP is discussed in detail and the implementation algorithm is proposed. In order to compare the performance of the TLRSP model with that of other mobile replication schemes we have developed a detailed simulation model. Experimental results show that the TLRSP model provides an efficient support for replicated mobile database systems by reducing reprocessing overhead and maintaining database consistency,"['mobile database', 'data replication', 'distributed database', 'multidatabase', 'mobile database replication', 'Transaction-Level Result-Set Propagation', 'mobile computing', 'conflict reconciliation', 'transaction', 'concurrency control', 'mobile computing', 'replicated databases', 'transaction processing']",133,13
964,1124,Data extraction from the Web based on pre-defined schema With the development of the Internet the World Wide Web has become an invaluable information source for most organizations. However most documents available from the Web are in HTML form which is originally designed for document formatting with little consideration of its contents. Effectively extracting data from such documents remains a nontrivial task. In this paper we present a schema-guided approach to extracting data from HTML pages. Under the approach the user defines a schema specifying what to be extracted and provides sample mappings between the schema and the HTML page. The system will induce the mapping rules and generate a wrapper that takes the HTML page as input and produces the required data in the form of XML conforming to the user-defined schema. A prototype system implementing the approach has been developed. The preliminary experiments indicate that the proposed semi-automatic approach is not only easy to use but also able to produce a wrapper that extracts required data from inputted pages with high accuracy,"['data extraction', 'wrapper generation', 'data integration', 'Internet', 'information source', 'schema', 'HTML', 'distributed database', 'queries', 'distributed databases', 'hypermedia markup languages', 'information resources', 'query processing']",174,13

In this paper we give a characterization of the structure of weakly invertible semi-input-memory finite automata with delay 1 in which the state graph of each autonomous finite automaton is a cycle.

967,1127,Repeated games with lack of information on one side the dual differential approach We introduce the dual differential game of a repeated game with lack of information on one side as the natural continuous time version of the dual game introduced by De Meyer 1996). A traditional way to study the value of differential games is through discrete time approximations. Here we follow the opposite approach We identify the limit value of a repeated game in discrete time as the value of a differential game. Namely we use the recursive structure for the finitely repeated version of the dual game to construct a differential game for which the upper values of the uniform discretization satisfy precisely the same property. The value of the dual differential game exists and is the unique viscosity solution of a first-order derivative equation with a limit condition. We identify the solution by translating viscosity properties in the primal,"['repeated games', 'dual differential game', 'repeated game', 'discrete time approximations', 'limit value', 'discrete time', 'viscosity solution', 'limit condition', 'differential games', 'duality (mathematics)']",153,10

970,1130,Node-capacitated ring routing We consider the node-capacitated routing problem in an undirected ring network along with its fractional relaxation the node-capacitated multicommodity flow problem. For the feasibility problem Farkas lemma provides a characterization for general undirected graphs asserting roughly that there exists such a flow if and only if the so-called distance inequality holds for every choice of distance functions arising from nonnegative node weights. For rings this straightforward result will be improved in two ways. We prove that independent of the integrality of node capacities it suffices to require the distance inequality only for distances arising from 0-1-2)-valued node weights a requirement that will be called the double-cut condition. Moreover for integer-valued node capacities the double-cut condition implies the existence of a half-integral multicommodity flow. In this case there is even an integer-valued multicommodity flow that violates each node capacity by at most one. Our approach gives rise to a combinatorial strongly polynomial algorithm to compute either a violating double-cut or a node-capacitated multicommodity flow.

The consequence is a min-max relation on packing and covering cycles together with strongly polynomial time algorithms for the feedback vertex set problem and the cycle packing problem on the corresponding bipartite tournaments. In addition we show that the feedback vertex set problem on general bipartite tournaments is NP-complete and approximable within 3.5 based on the min-max theorem,"['feedback vertex sets', 'min-max theorem', 'necessary sufficient condition', 'linear system', 'bipartite tournament', 'totally dual integral system', 'cycle-vertex incidence matrix', 'all-one vector', 'covering cycles', 'strongly polynomial time algorithms', 'cycle packing problem', 'feedback vertex set problem', 'NP-complete problem', 'graphs', 'combinatorial optimization problems', 'linear programming duality theory', 'bin packing', 'duality (mathematics)', 'feedback', 'graph theory', 'linear programming', 'linear systems', 'minimax techniques', 'polynomial approximation']",106,24

973,1133,An analytic center cutting plane method for semidefinite feasibility problems Semidefinite feasibility problems arise in many areas of operations research. The abstract form of these problems can be described as finding a point in a nonempty bounded convex body Gamma in the cone of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices. Assume that Gamma is defined by an oracle which for any given m  m symmetric positive semidefinite matrix Gamma either confirms that Y epsilon Gamma or returns a cut i.e. a symmetric matrix A such that Gamma is in the half-space Y  A . Y or= A . Y}. We study an analytic center cutting plane algorithm for this problem. At each iteration the algorithm computes an approximate analytic center of a working set defined by the cutting plane system generated in the previous iterations. If this approximate analytic center is a solution then the algorithm terminates otherwise the new cutting plane returned by the oracle is added into the system. As the number of iterations increases the working set shrinks and the algorithm eventually finds a solution to the problem. All iterates generated by the algorithm are positive definite matrices. The algorithm has a worst-case complexity of O*(m/sup 3 epsilon sup 2 on the total number of cuts to be used where epsilon is the maximum radius of a ball contained by Gamma,"['semidefinite feasibility problems', 'analytic center cutting plane method', 'operations research', 'nonempty bounded convex body', 'symmetric positive semidefinite matrices', 'oracle', 'iteration', 'approximate analytic center', 'working set', 'worst-case complexity', 'maximum ball radius', 'computational complexity', 'convergence of numerical methods', 'iterative methods', 'matrix algebra', 'Newton method', 'operations research']",222,17
974,1134,Relationship between strong monotonicity property P/sub 2/-property and the GUS-property in semidefinite linear complementarity problems In a recent paper on semidefinite linear complementarity problems Gowda and Song 2000 introduced and studied the P-property P/sub 2/-property GUS-property and strong monotonicity property for linear transformation L S/sup n to S/sup n where S/sup n is the space of all symmetric and real n  n matrices. In an attempt to characterize the P/sub 2/-property they raised the following two questions i Does the strong monotonicity imply the P/sub 2/-property ii Does the GUS-property imply the P/sub 2/-property In this paper we show that the strong monotonicity property implies the P/sub 2/-property for any linear transformation and describe an equivalence between these two properties for Lyapunov and other transformations.

975,1135,A combinatorial graph-based solution method for a class of continuous-time optimal control problems The paper addresses a class of continuous-time optimal control problems whose solutions are typically characterized by both bang-bang and singular control regimes. Analytical study and numerical computation of such solutions are very difficult and far from complete when only techniques from control theory are used. This paper solves optimal control problems by reducing them to the combinatorial search for the shortest path in a specially constructed graph. Since the nodes of the graph are weighted in a sequence-dependent manner we extend the classical shortest-path algorithm to our case. The proposed solution method is currently limited to single-state problems with multiple control functions.

979,1139,Development and evaluation of a case-based reasoning classifier for prediction of breast biopsy outcome with BI-RADS/sup TM lexicon Approximately 70-85 of breast biopsies are performed on benign lesions. To reduce this high number of biopsies performed on benign lesions a case-based reasoning CBR classifier was developed to predict biopsy results from BI-RADS/sup TM findings. We used 1433 931 benign biopsy-proven mammographic cases. CBR similarity was defined using either the Hamming or Euclidean distance measure over case features. Ten features represented each case calcification distribution calcification morphology calcification number mass margin mass shape mass density mass size associated findings special cases and age. Performance was evaluated using Round Robin sampling Receiver Operating Characteristic ROC analysis and bootstrap. To determine the most influential features for the CBR an exhaustive feature search was performed over all possible feature combinations 1022 and similarity thresholds. Influential features were defined as the most frequently occurring features in the feature subsets with the highest partial ROC areas sub 0.90/AUC). For CBR with Hamming distance the most influential features were found to be mass margin calcification morphology age calcification distribution calcification number and mass shape resulting in an sub 0.90/AUC of 0.33. At 95 sensitivity the Hamming CBR would spare from biopsy 34 of the benign lesions. At 98 sensitivity the Hamming CBR would spare 27 benign lesions. For the CBR with Euclidean distance the most influential feature subset consisted of mass margin calcification morphology age mass density and associated findings resulting in sub 0.90/AUC of 0.37. At 95 sensitivity the Euclidean CBR would spare from biopsy 41 benign lesions. At 98 sensitivity the Euclidean CBR would spare 27 benign lesions. The profile of cases spared by both distance measures at 98 sensitivity indicates that the CBR is a potentially useful diagnostic tool for the classification of mammographic lesions by recommending short-term follow-up for likely benign lesions that is in agreement with final biopsy results and mammographer's intuition,"['case-based reasoning classifier', 'breast biopsy outcome', 'BI-RADS lexicon', 'benign lesions', 'biopsy-proven mammographic cases', 'CBR similarity', 'Hamming distance measure', 'Euclidean distance measure', 'calcification distribution', 'calcification morphology', 'calcification number', 'mass margin', 'mass shape', 'mass density', 'mass size', 'associated findings', 'special cases', 'age', 'Round Robin sampling', 'Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis', 'bootstrap', 'feature combinations', 'similarity thresholds', 'feature subsets', 'highest partial ROC areas', 'influential features', 'diagnostic tool', 'mammographic lesion classification', 'short-term follow-up', 'biological organs', 'cancer', 'case-based reasoning', 'feature extraction', 'image classification', 'mammography', 'medical expert systems', 'medical image processing', 'sensitivity analysis']",320,38
980,1140,Computer aided classification of masses in ultrasonic mammography Frequency compounding was recently investigated for computer aided classification of masses in ultrasonic B-mode images as benign or malignant. The classification was performed using the normalized parameters of the Nakagami distribution at a single region of interest at the site of the mass. A combination of normalized Nakagami parameters from two different images of a mass was undertaken to improve the performance of classification. Receiver operating characteristic ROC analysis showed that such an approach resulted in an area of 0.83 under the ROC curve. The aim of the work described in this paper is to see whether a feature describing the characteristic of the boundary can be extracted and combined with the Nakagami parameter to further improve the performance of classification. The combination of the features has been performed using a weighted summation. Results indicate a 10 improvement in specificity at a sensitivity of 96 after combining the information at the site and at the boundary. Moreover the technique requires minimal clinical intervention and has a performance that reaches that of the trained radiologist.

981,1141,Reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position Purpose In breast conserving therapy complete excision of the tumor with an acceptable cosmetic outcome depends on accurate localization in terms of both the position of the lesion and its extent. We hypothesize that preoperative contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance MR imaging of the patient in a supine position may be used for accurate tumor localization and marking of its extent immediately prior to surgery. Our aims in this study are to assess the reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position to evaluate the effect of a breast immobilization device and to derive reproducibility margins that take internal tissue shifts into account occurring between repeat setups. Materials Methods The reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position is estimated by quantification of tissue shifts in the breasts of healthy volunteers between repeat MR setups. For each volunteer fiducials are identified and registered with their counter locations in corresponding MR volumes. The difference in position denotes the shift of breast tissue. The dependence on breast volume and the part of the breast as well as the effect of a breast immobilization cast are studied. Results The tissue shifts are small with a mean standard deviation on the order of 1.5 mm being slightly larger in large breasts V>1000 cm/sup 3 and in the posterior part toward the pectoral muscle of both small and large breasts. The application of a breast immobilization cast reduces the tissue shifts in large breasts. A reproducibility margin on the order of 5 mm will take the internal tissue shifts into account that occur between repeat setups.

982,1142,Fast and accurate leaf verification for dynamic multileaf collimation using an electronic portal imaging device A prerequisite for accurate dose delivery of IMRT profiles produced with dynamic multileaf collimation DMLC is highly accurate leaf positioning. In our institution leaf verification for DMLC was initially done with film and ionization chamber. To overcome the limitations of these methods a fast accurate and two-dimensional method for daily leaf verification using our CCD-camera based electronic portal imaging device EPID has been developed. This method is based on a flat field produced with a 0.5 cm wide sliding gap for each leaf pair. Deviations in gap widths are detected as deviations in gray scale value profiles derived from the EPID images and not by directly assessing leaf positions in the images. Dedicated software was developed to reduce the noise level in the low signal images produced with the narrow gaps. The accuracy of this quality assurance procedure was tested by introducing known leaf position errors. It was shown that errors in leaf gap as small as 0.01-0.02 cm could be detected which is certainly adequate to guarantee accurate dose delivery of DMLC treatments even for strongly modulated beam profiles. Using this method it was demonstrated that both short and long term reproducibility in leaf positioning were within 0.01 cm 1 sigma  for all gantry angles and that the effect of gravity was negligible,"['accurate leaf verification', 'dynamic multileaf collimation', 'electronic portal imaging device', 'accurate dose delivery', 'intensity modulated radiation therapy profiles', 'ionization chamber', 'two-dimensional method', 'CCD-camera based electronic portal imaging device', 'sliding gap', 'leaf pair', 'gap widths', 'gray scale value profiles', 'electronic portal imaging device images', 'noise level', 'signal images', 'leaf position errors', 'modulated beam profiles', 'leaf positioning', 'gantry angles', 'diagnostic radiography', 'dosimetry', 'medical image processing', 'radiation therapy', 'X-ray optics']",229,24
983,1143,A three-source model for the calculation of head scatter factors Accurate determination of the head scatter factor S/sub c is an important issue especially for intensity modulated radiation therapy where the segmented fields are often very irregular and much less than the collimator jaw settings. In this work we report an S/sub c calculation algorithm for symmetric asymmetric and irregular open fields shaped by the tertiary collimator a multileaf collimator or blocks at different source-to-chamber distance. The algorithm was based on a three-source model in which the photon radiation to the point of calculation was treated as if it originated from three effective sources one source for the primary photons from the target and two extra-focal photon sources for the scattered photons from the primary collimator and the flattening filter respectively. The field mapping method proposed by Kim et al. Phys. Med. Biol. 43 1593-1604 1998 was extended to two extra-focal source planes and the scatter contributions were integrated over the projected areas determined by the detector's eye view in the three source planes considering the source intensity distributions. The algorithm was implemented using Microsoft Visual C/C++ in the MS Windows environment. The only input data required were head scatter factors for symmetric square fields which are normally acquired during machine commissioning. A large number of different fields were used to evaluate the algorithm and the results were compared with measurements. We found that most of the calculated S/sub c/'s agreed with the measured values to within 0.4%.

984,1144,Simultaneous iterative reconstruction of emission and attenuation images in positron emission tomography from emission data only For quantitative image reconstruction in positron emission tomography attenuation correction is mandatory. In case that no data are available for the calculation of the attenuation correction factors one can try to determine them from the emission data alone. However it is not clear if the information content is sufficient to yield an adequate attenuation correction together with a satisfactory activity distribution. Therefore we determined the log likelihood distribution for a thorax phantom depending on the choice of attenuation and activity pixel values to measure the crosstalk between both. In addition an iterative image reconstruction one-dimensional Newton-type algorithm with a maximum likelihood estimator which simultaneously reconstructs the images of the activity distribution and the attenuation coefficients is used to demonstrate the problems and possibilities of such a reconstruction. As result we show that for a change of the log likelihood in the range of statistical noise the associated change in the activity value of a structure is between 6 and 263%. In addition we show that it is not possible to choose the best maximum on the basis of the log likelihood when a regularization is used because the coupling between different structures mediated by the smoothing regularization prevents an adequate solution due to crosstalk. We conclude that taking into account the attenuation information in the emission data improves the performance of image reconstruction with respect to the bias of the activities however the reconstruction still is not quantitative,"['image reconstruction', 'positron emission tomography attenuation correction', 'attenuation correction factors', 'log likelihood distribution', 'thorax phantom', 'activity pixel values', 'crosstalk', 'iterative image reconstruction', 'one-dimensional Newton-type algorithm', 'maximum likelihood estimator', 'activity distribution', 'attenuation coefficients', 'statistical noise', 'smoothing', 'attenuation information', 'eigenvalues and eigenfunctions', 'image reconstruction', 'iterative methods', 'maximum likelihood estimation', 'medical image processing', 'optimisation', 'positron emission tomography']",254,22
985,1145,Mammogram synthesis using a 3D simulation. II. Evaluation of synthetic mammogram texture We have evaluated a method for synthesizing mammograms by comparing the texture of clinical and synthetic mammograms. The synthesis algorithm is based upon simulations of breast tissue and the mammographic imaging process. Mammogram texture was synthesized by projections of simulated adipose tissue compartments. It was hypothesized that the synthetic and clinical texture have similar properties assuming that the mammogram texture reflects the 3D tissue distribution. The size of the projected compartments was computed by mathematical morphology. The texture energy and fractal dimension were also computed and analyzed in terms of the distribution of texture features within four different tissue regions in clinical and synthetic mammograms. Comparison of the cumulative distributions of the mean features computed from 95 mammograms showed that the synthetic images simulate the mean features of the texture of clinical mammograms. Correlation of clinical and synthetic texture feature histograms averaged over all images showed that the synthetic images can simulate the range of features seen over a large group of mammograms. The best agreement with clinical texture was achieved for simulated compartments with radii of 4-13.3 mm in predominantly adipose tissue regions and radii of 2.7-5.33 and 1.3-2.7 mm in retroareolar and dense fibroglandular tissue regions respectively,"['mammogram synthesis', '3D simulation', 'synthetic mammogram texture', 'breast tissue simulation', 'adipose tissue compartments', '3D tissue distribution', 'mathematical morphology', 'fractal dimension', 'cumulative distributions', 'synthetic images', 'dense fibroglandular tissue regions', 'retroareolar tissue regions', 'X-ray image acquisition', 'computationally compressed phantom', 'biological tissues', 'computer graphics', 'diagnostic radiography', 'fractals', 'image registration', 'image texture', 'mammography', 'mathematical morphology', 'medical image processing', 'physiological models']",211,24

Parameters controlling the size and placement of simulated structures adipose compartments and ducts provide a method for consistently modeling images of the same simulated breast with modified position or acquisition parameters. The mammographic imaging process is simulated using a compression model and a model of the X-ray image acquisition process. The compression model estimates breast deformation using tissue elasticity parameters found in the literature and clinical force values.

987,1147,Angular disparity in ETACT scintimammography Emission tuned aperture computed tomography ETACT has been previously shown to have the potential for the detection of small tumors 1 cm in scintimammography. However the optimal approach to the application of ETACT in the clinic has yet to be determined. Therefore we sought to determine the effect of the angular disparity between the ETACT projections on image quality through the use of a computer simulation. A small spherical tumor of variable size 5 7.5 or 10 mm was placed at the center of a hemispherical breast 15 cm diameter). The tumor to nontumor ratio was either 5:1 or 10:1. The detector was modeled to be a gamma camera fitted with a 4-mm-diam pinhole collimator. The pinhole-to-detector and the pinhole-to-tumor distances were 25 and 15 cm respectively. A ray tracing technique was used to generate three sets of projections 10 degrees  15 degrees  and 20 degrees  angular disparity). These data were blurred to a resolution consistent with the 4 mm pinhole. The TACT reconstruction method was used to reconstruct these three image sets. The tumor contrast and the axial spatial resolution was measured. Smaller angular disparity led to an improvement in image contrast but at a cost of degraded axial spatial resolution. The improvement in contrast is due to a slight improvement in the in-plane spatial resolution. Since improved contrast should lead to better tumor detectability smaller angular disparity should be used. However the difference in contrast between 10 degrees and 15 degrees was very slight and therefore a reasonable clinical choice for angular disparity is 15 degrees,"['emission tuned aperture computed tomography scintimammography', 'angular disparity', 'small tumors', 'image quality', 'computer simulation', 'spherical tumor', 'hemispherical breast', 'gamma camera', 'pinhole collimator', 'pinhole-to-detector distances', 'pinhole-to-tumor distances', 'ray tracing technique', 'tuned aperture computed tomography reconstruction method', 'image sets', 'axial spatial resolution', 'in-plane spatial resolution', 'clinical choice', 'cancer', 'digital simulation', 'emission tomography', 'image reconstruction', 'mammography', 'medical image processing', 'tumours']",263,24
988,1148,Benchmarking of the Dose Planning Method DPM Monte Carlo code using electron beams from a racetrack microtron A comprehensive set of measurements and calculations has been conducted to investigate the accuracy of the Dose Planning Method DPM Monte Carlo code for dose calculations from 10 and 50 MeV scanned electron beams produced from a racetrack microtron. Central axis depth dose measurements and a series of profile scans at various depths were acquired in a water phantom using a Scanditronix type RK ion chamber. Source spatial distributions for the Monte Carlo calculations were reconstructed from in-air ion chamber measurements carried out across the two-dimensional beam profile at 100 cm downstream from the source. The in-air spatial distributions were found to have full width at half maximum of 4.7 and 1.3 cm at 100 cm from the source for the 10 and 50 MeV beams respectively. Energy spectra for the 10 and 50 MeV beams were determined by simulating the components of the microtron treatment head using the code MCNP4B. DPM calculations are on average within +or-2 agreement with measurement for all depth dose and profile comparisons conducted in this study. The accuracy of the DPM code illustrated in this work suggests that DPM may be used as a valuable tool for electron beam dose calculations,"['dose planning method Monte Carlo code', 'scanned electron beams', 'racetrack microtron', 'benchmarking', 'central axis depth dose measurements', 'profile scans', 'water phantom', 'ion chamber', 'source spatial distributions', 'two-dimensional beam profile', 'in-air spatial distributions', 'MCNP4B', 'electron beam dose calculations', 'radiotherapy treatment planning', 'electron transport', 'scoring parameters', '10 MeV', '50 MeV', 'dosimetry', 'electron beam applications', 'electron transport theory', 'medical computing', 'Monte Carlo methods', 'radiation therapy']",214,24

990,1150,Effect of multileaf collimator leaf width on physical dose distributions in the treatment of CNS and head and neck neoplasms with intensity modulated radiation therapy The purpose of this work is to examine physical radiation dose differences between two multileaf collimator MLC leaf widths 5 and 10 mm in the treatment of CNS and head and neck neoplasms with intensity modulated radiation therapy IMRT). Three clinical patients with CNS tumors were planned with two different MLC leaf sizes 5 and 10 mm representing Varian-120 and Varian-80 Millennium multileaf collimators respectively. Two sets of IMRT treatment plans were developed. The goal of the first set was radiation dose conformality in three dimensions. The goal for the second set was organ avoidance of a nearby critical structure while maintaining adequate coverage of the target volume. Treatment planning utilized the CadPlan/Helios system Varian Medical Systems Milpitas CA for dynamic MLC treatment delivery. All beam parameters and optimization cost function parameters were identical for the 5 and 10 mm plans. For all cases the number of beams gantry positions and table positions were taken from clinically treated three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy plans. Conformality was measured by the ratio of the planning isodose volume to the target volume. Organ avoidance was measured by the volume of the critical structure receiving greater than 90 of the prescription dose V/sub 90/). For three patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck T2-T4 N0-N2c M0 5 and 10 mm leaf widths were compared for parotid preservation utilizing nine coplanar equally spaced beams delivering a simultaneous integrated boost. Because modest differences in physical dose to the parotid were detected a NTCP model based upon the clinical parameters of Eisbruch et al. was then used for comparisons. The conformality improved in all three CNS cases for the 5 mm plans compared to the 10 mm plans. For the organ avoidance plans V/sub 90 also improved in two of the three cases when the 5 mm leaf width was utilized for IMRT treatment delivery. In the third case both the 5 and 10 mm plans were able to spare the critical structure with none of the structure receiving more than 90 of the prescription dose but in the moderate dose range less dose was delivered to the critical structure with the 5 mm plan. For the head and neck cases both the 5 and 10*2.5 mm beamlets dMLC sliding window techniques spared the contralateral parotid gland while maintaining target volume coverage. The mean parotid dose was modestly lower with the smaller beamlet size 21.04 Gy vs 22.36 Gy). The resulting average NTCP values were 13.72 for 10 mm dMLC and 8.24 for 5 mm dMLC. In conclusion five mm leaf width results in an improvement in physical dose distribution over 10 mm leaf width that may be clinically relevant in some cases. These differences may be most pronounced for single fraction radiosurgery or in cases where the tolerance of the sensitive organ is less than or close to the target volume prescription,"['multileaf collimator leaf width', 'physical dose distributions', 'head and neck neoplasms', 'intensity modulated radiation therapy', 'CNS neoplasms', 'CNS tumors', 'treatment planning', 'parotid preservation', 'optimization parameters', 'conformal radiotherapy', 'single fraction radiosurgery', 'acceptable tumor coverage', 'minimal toxicity', 'collimator rotation', 'beamlet size', '5 mm', '10 mm', '21.04 Gy', '22.36 Gy', 'dosimetry', 'intensity modulation', 'medical computing', 'neurophysiology', 'radiation therapy', 'tumours']",502,25
991,1151,A method for geometrical verification of dynamic intensity modulated radiotherapy using a scanning electronic portal imaging device In order to guarantee the safe delivery of dynamic intensity modulated radiotherapy IMRT verification of the leaf trajectories during the treatment is necessary. Our aim in this study is to develop a method for on-line verification of leaf trajectories using an electronic portal imaging device with scanning read-out independent of the multileaf collimator. Examples of such scanning imagers are electronic portal imaging devices EPIDs based on liquid-filled ionization chambers and those based on amorphous silicon. Portal images were acquired continuously with a liquid-filled ionization chamber EPID during the delivery together with the signal of treatment progress that is generated by the accelerator. For each portal image the prescribed leaf and diaphragm positions were computed from the dynamic prescription and the progress information. Motion distortion effects of the leaves are corrected based on the treatment progress that is recorded for each image row. The aperture formed by the prescribed leaves and diaphragms is used as the reference field edge while the actual field edge is found using a maximum-gradient edge detector. The errors in leaf and diaphragm position are found from the deviations between the reference field edge and the detected field edge. Earlier measurements of the dynamic EPID response show that the accuracy of the detected field edge is better than 1 mm. To ensure that the verification is independent of inaccuracies in the acquired progress signal the signal was checked with diode measurements beforehand. The method was tested on three different dynamic prescriptions. Using the described method we correctly reproduced the distorted field edges. Verifying a single portal image took 0.1 s on an 866 MHz personal computer. Two flaws in the control system of our experimental dynamic multileaf collimator were correctly revealed with our method. First the errors in leaf position increase with leaf speed indicating a delay of approximately 0.8 s in the control system. Second the accuracy of the leaves and diaphragms depends on the direction of motion. In conclusion the described verification method is suitable for detailed verification of leaf trajectories during dynamic IMRT,"['dynamic intensity modulated radiotherapy', 'geometrical verification method', 'dynamic multileaf collimator', 'safe delivery', 'leaf trajectories', 'on-line verification', 'scanning read-out', 'liquid-filled ionization chambers', 'leaf positions', 'diaphragm positions', 'motion distortion effects', 'reference field edge', 'distorted field edges', 'control system', 'dose distributions', 'treatment planning', 'diaphragms', 'dosimetry', 'intensity modulation', 'liquid ionisation chambers', 'medical image processing', 'radiation therapy']",356,22
992,1152,Incorporating multi-leaf collimator leaf sequencing into iterative IMRT optimization Intensity modulated radiation therapy IMRT treatment planning typically considers beam optimization and beam delivery as separate tasks. Following optimization a multi-leaf collimator MLC or other beam delivery device is used to generate fluence patterns for patient treatment delivery. Due to limitations and characteristics of the MLC the deliverable intensity distributions often differ from those produced by the optimizer leading to differences between the delivered and the optimized doses. Objective function parameters are then adjusted empirically and the plan is reoptimized to achieve a desired deliverable dose distribution. The resulting plan though usually acceptable may not be the best achievable. A method has been developed to incorporate the MLC restrictions into the optimization process. Our in-house IMRT system has been modified to include the calculation of the deliverable intensity into the optimizer. In this process prior to dose calculation the MLC leaf sequencer is used to convert intensities to dynamic MLC sequences from which the deliverable intensities are then determined. All other optimization steps remain the same. To evaluate the effectiveness of deliverable-based optimization 17 patient cases have been studied. Compared with standard optimization plus conversion to deliverable beams deliverable-based optimization results show improved isodose coverage and a reduced dose to critical structures. Deliverable-based optimization results are close to the original nondeliverable optimization results suggesting that IMRT can overcome the MLC limitations by adjusting individual beamlets. The use of deliverable-based optimization may reduce the need for empirical adjustment of objective function parameters and reoptimization of a plan to achieve desired results,"['intensity modulated radiation therapy', 'treatment planning', 'iterative optimization', 'multileaf collimator leaf sequencing', 'beam delivery', 'beam optimization', 'fluence patterns', 'objective function parameters', 'deliverable dose distribution', 'empirical adjustment', 'tumor dose', 'optimized intensity', 'gradient-based search algorithm', 'beamlet ray intensities', 'Newton method', 'dose-volume objective values', 'dosimetry', 'gradient methods', 'medical computing', 'Newton method', 'optimisation', 'radiation therapy']",259,22
993,1153,Direct aperture optimization A turnkey solution for step-and-shoot IMRT IMRT treatment plans for step-and-shoot delivery have traditionally been produced through the optimization of intensity distributions or maps for each beam angle. The optimization step is followed by the application of a leaf-sequencing algorithm that translates each intensity map into a set of deliverable aperture shapes. In this article we introduce an automated planning system in which we bypass the traditional intensity optimization and instead directly optimize the shapes and the weights of the apertures. We call this approach direct aperture optimization. This technique allows the user to specify the maximum number of apertures per beam direction and hence provides significant control over the complexity of the treatment delivery. This is possible because the machine dependent delivery constraints imposed by the MLC are enforced within the aperture optimization algorithm rather than in a separate leaf-sequencing step. The leaf settings and the aperture intensities are optimized simultaneously using a simulated annealing algorithm. We have tested direct aperture optimization on a variety of patient cases using the EGS4/BEAM Monte Carlo package for our dose calculation engine. The results demonstrate that direct aperture optimization can produce highly conformal step-and-shoot treatment plans using only three to five apertures per beam direction. As compared with traditional optimization strategies our studies demonstrate that direct aperture optimization can result in a significant reduction in both the number of beam segments and the number of monitor units. Direct aperture optimization therefore produces highly efficient treatment deliveries that maintain the full dosimetric benefits of IMRT,"['direct aperture optimization', 'turnkey solution', 'step-and-shoot IMRT', 'IMRT treatment plans', 'intensity distributions', 'maps', 'beam angle', 'optimization step', 'leaf-sequencing algorithm', 'intensity map', 'deliverable aperture shapes', 'automated planning system', 'aperture weights', 'aperture shapes', 'treatment delivery complexity', 'machine dependent delivery constraints', 'MLC', 'aperture optimization algorithm', 'leaf settings', 'aperture intensities', 'simulated annealing algorithm', 'patient cases', 'EGS4/BEAM Monte Carlo package', 'dose calculation engine', 'highly conformal step-and-shoot treatment plans', 'beam segments', 'monitor units', 'highly efficient treatment deliveries', 'full dosimetric benefits', 'dosimetry', 'intensity modulation', 'inverse problems', 'medical computing', 'Monte Carlo methods', 'optimisation', 'planning', 'radiation therapy', 'simulated annealing']",255,38
994,1154,The effect of voxel size on the accuracy of dose-volume histograms of prostate sup 125/I seed implants Cumulative dose-volume histograms DVH are crucial in evaluating the quality of radioactive seed prostate implants. When calculating DVHs the choice of voxel size is a compromise between computational speed larger voxels and accuracy smaller voxels). We quantified the effect of voxel size on the accuracy of DVHs using an in-house computer program. The program was validated by comparison with a hand-calculated DVH for a single 0.4-U iodine-125 model 6711 seed. We used the program to find the voxel size required to obtain accurate DVHs of five iodine-125 prostate implant patients at our institution. One-millimeter cubes were sufficient to obtain DVHs that are accurate within 5 up to 200 of the prescription dose. For the five patient plans we obtained good agreement with the VariSeed version 6.7 Varian USA treatment planning software's DVH algorithm by using voxels with a sup-inf dimension equal to the spacing between successive transverse seed implant planes 5 mm). The volume that receives at least 200 of the target dose V/sub 200 calculated by VariSeed was 30 to 43 larger than that calculated by our program with small voxels. The single-seed DVH calculated by VariSeed fell below the hand calculation by up to 50 at low doses 30 Gy and above it by over 50 at high doses 250 Gy,"['cumulative dose-volume histograms', 'prostate /sup 125/I seed implants', 'radioactive seed prostate implants', 'voxel size', 'computational speed', 'in-house computer program', 'hand-calculated dose-volume histograms', 'single-seed dose-volume histograms', '/sup 125/I model', '/sup 125/I prostate implant patients', ""VariSeed treatment planning software's dose-volume histogram algorithm"", 'I', 'dosimetry', 'iodine', 'medical computing', 'radiation therapy', 'radioactive sources', 'radioisotopes']",230,18
995,1155,A leaf sequencing algorithm to enlarge treatment field length in IMRT With MLC-based IMRT the maximum usable field size is often smaller than the maximum field size for conventional treatments. This is due to the constraints of the overtravel distances of MLC leaves and/or jaws. Using a new leaf sequencing algorithm the usable IMRT field length perpendicular to the MLC motion can be mostly made equal to the full length of the MLC field without violating the upper jaw overtravel limit. For any given intensity pattern a criterion was proposed to assess whether an intensity pattern can be delivered without violation of the jaw position constraints. If the criterion is met the new algorithm will consider the jaw position constraints during the segmentation for the step and shoot delivery method. The strategy employed by the algorithm is to connect the intensity elements outside the jaw overtravel limits with those inside the jaw overtravel limits. Several methods were used to establish these connections during segmentation by modifying a previously published algorithm areal algorithm including changing the intensity level alternating the leaf-sequencing direction or limiting the segment field size. The algorithm was tested with 1000 random intensity patterns with dimensions of 21*27 cm/sup 2 800 intensity patterns with higher intensity outside the jaw overtravel limit and three different types of clinical treatment plans that were undeliverable using a segmentation method from a commercial treatment planning system. The new algorithm achieved a success rate of 100 with these test patterns. For the 1000 random patterns the new algorithm yields a similar average number of segments of 36.9+or-2.9 in comparison to 36.6+or-1.3 when using the areal algorithm. For the 800 patterns with higher intensities outside the jaw overtravel limits the new algorithm results in an increase of 25 in the average number of segments compared to the areal algorithm. However the areal algorithm fails to create deliverable segments for 90 of these patterns. Using a single isocenter the new algorithm provides a solution to extend the usable IMRT field length from 21 to 27 cm for IMRT on a commercial linear accelerator using the step and shoot delivery method,"['leaf sequencing algorithm', 'usable intensity modulated radiation therapy field length', 'overtravel distances', 'multileaf-based collimators intensity modulated radiation therapy', 'conformal radiation therapy', 'multileaf collimators jaws', 'multileaf collimators leaves', 'upper jaw overtravel limit', 'intensity pattern', 'jaw position constraints', 'step and shoot delivery method', 'commercial treatment planning system', 'random patterns', 'deliverable segments', 'single isocenter', 'commercial linear accelerator', 'treatment field length', 'intensity elements', 'jaw overtravel limits', 'areal algorithm', 'leaf-sequencing direction', 'segment field size', 'random intensity patterns', 'segmentation method', 'algorithm theory', 'linear accelerators', 'radiation therapy', 'X-ray optics']",355,28
996,1156,Favorable noise uniformity properties of Fourier-based interpolation and reconstruction approaches in single-slice helical computed tomography Volumes reconstructed by standard methods from single-slice helical computed tomography CT data have been shown to have noise levels that are highly nonuniform relative to those in conventional CT. These noise nonuniformities can affect low-contrast object detectability and have also been identified as the cause of the zebra artifacts that plague maximum intensity projection MIP images of such volumes. While these spatially variant noise levels have their root in the peculiarities of the helical scan geometry there is also a strong dependence on the interpolation and reconstruction algorithms employed. In this paper we seek to develop image reconstruction strategies that eliminate or reduce at its source the nonuniformity of noise levels in helical CT relative to that in conventional CT. We pursue two approaches independently and in concert. We argue and verify that Fourier-based longitudinal interpolation approaches lead to more uniform noise ratios than do the standard 360LI and 180LI approaches. We also demonstrate that a Fourier-based fan-to-parallel rebinning algorithm used as an alternative to fanbeam filtered backprojection for slice reconstruction also leads to more uniform noise ratios even when making use of the 180LI and 360LI interpolation approaches,"['Fourier-based interpolation', 'single-slice helical computed tomography', 'reconstruction approaches', 'noise uniformity properties', 'medical diagnostic imaging', 'conventional CT', 'Fourier-based fan-to-parallel rebinning algorithm', 'more uniform noise ratios', 'low-contrast object detectability', 'zebra artifacts', 'maximum intensity projection images', 'helical span geometry', 'computerised tomography', 'image reconstruction', 'interpolation', 'medical image processing', 'noise']",204,17

1010,1170,Upper bound analysis of oblique cutting with nose radius tools A generalized upper bound model for calculating the chip flow angle in oblique cutting using flat-faced nose radius tools is described. The projection of the uncut chip area on the rake face is divided into a number of elements parallel to an assumed chip flow direction. The length of each of these elements is used to find the length of the corresponding element on the shear surface using the ratio of the shear velocity to the chip velocity. The area of each element is found as the cross product of the length and its width along the cutting edge. Summing up the area of the elements along the shear surface the total shear surface area is obtained. The friction area is calculated using the similarity between orthogonal and oblique cutting in the equivalent plane that includes both the cutting velocity and chip velocity. The cutting power is obtained by summing the shear power and the friction power.

1011,1171,Manufacturing data analysis of machine tool errors within a contemporary small manufacturing enterprise The main focus of the paper is directed at the determination of manufacturing errors within the contemporary smaller manufacturing enterprise sector. The manufacturing error diagnosis is achieved through the manufacturing data analysis of the results obtained from the inspection of the component on a co-ordinate measuring machine. This manufacturing data analysis activity adopts a feature-based approach and is conducted through the application of a forward chaining expert system called the product data analysis distributed diagnostic expert system which forms part of a larger prototype feedback system entitled the production data analysis framework. The paper introduces the manufacturing error categorisations that are associated with milling type operations knowledge acquisition and representation conceptual structure and operating procedure of the prototype manufacturing data analysis facility. The paper concludes with a brief evaluation of the logic employed through the simulation of manufacturing error scenarios.

1012,1172,Marble cutting with single point cutting tool and diamond segments An investigation has been undertaken into the frame sawing with diamond blades. The kinematic behaviour of the frame sawing process is discussed. Under different cutting conditions cutting and indenting-cutting tests are carried out by single point cutting tools and single diamond segments. The results indicate that the depth of cut per diamond grit increases as the blades move forward. Only a few grits per segment can remove the material in the cutting process. When the direction of the stroke changes the cutting forces do not decrease to zero because of the residual plastic deformation beneath the diamond grits. The plastic deformation and fracture chipping of material are the dominant removal processes which can be explained by the fracture theory of brittle material indentation,"['marble cutting', 'single point cutting tool', 'diamond segments', 'frame sawing', 'kinematic behaviour', 'cutting tests', 'indenting-cutting tests', 'residual plastic deformation', 'fracture chipping', 'removal processes', 'fracture theory', 'brittle material indentation', 'computerised numerical control', 'cutting', 'diamond', 'kinematics', 'machining', 'plastic deformation']",133,18

1015,1175,Prediction of tool and chip temperature in continuous and interrupted machining A numerical model based on the finite difference method is presented to predict tool and chip temperature fields in continuous machining and time varying milling processes. Continuous or steady state machining operations like orthogonal cutting are studied by modeling the heat transfer between the tool and chip at the tool-rake face contact zone. The shear energy created in the primary zone the friction energy produced at the rake face-chip contact zone and the heat balance between the moving chip and stationary tool are considered. The temperature distribution is solved using the finite difference method. Later the model is extended to milling where the cutting is interrupted and the chip thickness varies with time. The proposed model combines the steady-state temperature prediction in continuous machining with transient temperature evaluation in interrupted cutting operations where the chip and the process change in a discontinuous manner. The mathematical models and simulation results are in satisfactory agreement with experimental temperature measurements reported in the literature,"['tool temperature prediction', 'chip temperature prediction', 'continuous machining', 'interrupted machining', 'numerical model', 'finite difference method', 'time varying milling processes', 'orthogonal cutting', 'heat transfer', 'tool-rake face contact zone', 'shear energy', 'primary zone', 'friction energy', 'temperature distribution', 'first-order dynamic system', 'thermal properties', 'cutting', 'finite difference methods', 'heat transfer', 'machine tools', 'machining', 'mechanical engineering computing', 'wear']",172,23

All of these rather diverse approaches that have been available are covered in this study. Only in a few of the papers have attempts been made to compare the chosen approach with other methods.

1017,1177,Comparative statistical analysis of hole taper and circularity in laser percussion drilling Investigates the relationships and parameter interactions between six controllable variables on the hole taper and circularity in laser percussion drilling. Experiments have been conducted on stainless steel workpieces and a comparison was made between stainless steel and mild steel. The central composite design was employed to plan the experiments in order to achieve required information with reduced number of experiments. The process performance was evaluated. The ratio of minimum to maximum Feret's diameter was considered as circularity characteristic of the hole. The models of these three process characteristics were developed by linear multiple regression technique. The significant coefficients were obtained by performing analysis of variance ANOVA at 1 5 and 7 levels of significance. The final models were checked by complete residual analysis and finally were experimentally verified. It was found that the pulse frequency had a significant effect on the hole entrance diameter and hole circularity in drilling stainless steel unlike the drilling of mild steel where the pulse frequency had no significant effect on the hole characteristics,"['comparative statistical analysis', 'hole taper', 'circularity', 'laser percussion drilling', 'stainless steel workpieces', 'mild steel', 'laser peak power', 'laser pulse width', 'pulse frequency', 'assist gas pressure', 'focal plane position', 'central composite design', 'process performance', 'equivalent entrance diameter', 'Ferets diameter', 'linear multiple regression technique', 'least squares procedure', 'stepwise regression method', 'analysis of variance', 'ANOVA', 'complete residual analysis', 'carbon steel', 'laser beam machining', 'stainless steel', 'statistical analysis']",181,25

1021,1181,Dynamic neighborhood structures in parallel evolution strategies Parallelizing is a straightforward approach to reduce the total computation time of evolutionary algorithms. Finding an appropriate communication network within spatially structured populations for improving convergence speed and convergence probability is a difficult task. A new method that uses a dynamic communication scheme in an evolution strategy will be compared with conventional static and dynamic approaches. The communication structure is based on a so-called diffusion model approach. The links between adjacent individuals are dynamically chosen according to deterministic or probabilistic rules.

The emergent desired behavior is a distributed sorting and clustering based only on local information and a memory register that records the past objects encountered. An optimum weighting function for the memory registers is theoretically derived. The optimum time-dependent weighting function allows sorting and clustering of the randomly distributed objects in the shortest time. By maximizing the average speed of a texture feature the contrast we check the central assumption the intermediate steady-states hypothesis of our theoretical result. It is proved that the algorithm optimization based on maximum speed variation of the contrast feature gives relationships similar to the theoretically derived annealing law,"['autonomous mobile agents', 'random walk', 'memory weighting function', 'sorting', 'clustering', 'algorithm optimization', 'distributed algorithms', 'mobile computing', 'robots', 'self-adjusting systems', 'software agents', 'sorting']",156,12

We prove some statements about the monotonicity conservation and total monotonicity of one-step vector-iterations.

Some methods have been specially devised for this kind of problem. In most of them the calculation of the coefficients needs more computational effort than the classical codes because such coefficients depend on the step-size in a not simple manner. On the contrary in this work we present new algorithms specially designed for perturbed oscillators whose coefficients have a simple dependence on the step-size.

1036,1196,Multiple shooting using a dichotomically stable integrator for solving differential-algebraic equations In previous work by the first author it has been established that a dichotomically stable discretization is needed when solving a stiff boundary-value problem in ordinary differential equations ODEs when sharp boundary layers may occur at each end of the interval. A dichotomically stable implicit Runge-Kutta method using the 3-stage fourth-order Lobatto IIIA formulae has been implemented in a variable step-size initial-value integrator which could be used in a multiple-shooting approach. In the case of index-one differential-algebraic equations DAEs the use of the Lobatto IIIA formulae has an advantage over a comparable Gaussian method that the order is the same for both differential and algebraic variables and there is no need to treat them separately. The ODE integrator has been adapted for the solution of index-one DAEs and the resulting integrator SYMDAE has been inserted into the multiple-shooting code MSHDAE previously developed by R. Lamour for differential-algebraic boundary-value problems. The standard version of MSHDAE uses a BDF integrator which is not dichotomically stable and for some stiff test problems this fails to integrate across the interval of interest while the dichotomically stable integrator SYMDAE encounters no difficulty. Indeed for such problems the modified version of MSHDAE produces an accurate solution and within limits imposed by computer word length the efficiency of the solution process improves with increasing stiffness. For some nonstiff problems the solution is also entirely satisfactory,"['multiple shooting', 'stiff boundary-value problem', 'ordinary differential equations', 'implicit Runge-Kutta method', 'Lobatto IIIA formulae', 'initial-value integrator', 'dichotomically stable integrator', 'differential-algebraic equations', 'boundary-value problems', 'differential equations', 'Runge-Kutta methods', 'stability']",239,12

1044,1204,Design and prototype of a performance tool interface for OpenMP This paper proposes a performance tools interface for OpenMP similar in spirit to the MPI profiling interface in its intent to define a clear and portable API that makes OpenMP execution events visible to runtime performance tools. We present our design using a source-level instrumentation approach based on OpenMP directive rewriting. Rules to instrument each directive and their combination are applied to generate calls to the interface consistent with directive semantics and to pass context information e.g. source code locations in a portable and efficient way. Our proposed OpenMP performance API further allows user functions and arbitrary code regions to be marked and performance measurement to be controlled using new OpenMP directives. To prototype the proposed OpenMP performance interface we have developed compatible performance libraries for the EXPERT automatic event trace analyzer 17 18 and the TAU performance analysis framework 13]. The directive instrumentation transformations we define are implemented in a source-to-source translation tool called OPARI. Application examples are presented for both EXPERT and TAU to show the OpenMP performance interface and OPARI instrumentation tool in operation.

1045,1205,HPCVIEW a tool for top-down analysis of node performance It is increasingly difficult for complex scientific programs to attain a significant fraction of peak performance on systems that are based on microprocessors with substantial instruction-level parallelism and deep memory hierarchies. Despite this trend performance analysis and tuning tools are still not used regularly by algorithm and application designers. To a large extent existing performance tools fail to meet many user needs and are cumbersome to use. To address these issues we developed HPCVIEW  a toolkit for combining multiple sets of program profile data correlating the data with source code and generating a database that can be analyzed anywhere with a commodity Web browser. We argue that HPCVIEW addresses many of the issues that have limited the usability and the utility of most existing tools. We originally built HPCVIEW to facilitate our own work on data layout and optimizing compilers.

1046,1206,The MAGNeT toolkit design implementation and evaluation The current trend in constructing high-performance computing systems is to connect a large number of machines via a fast interconnect or a large-scale network such as the Internet. This approach relies on the performance of the interconnect or Internet to enable fast large-scale distributed computing. A detailed understanding of the communication traffic is required in order to optimize the operation of the entire system. Network researchers traditionally monitor traffic in the network to gain the insight necessary to optimize network operations. Recent work suggests additional insight can be obtained by also monitoring traffic at the application level.

1047,1207,Packet spacing an enabling mechanism for delivering multimedia content in computational grids Streaming multimedia with UDP has become increasingly popular over distributed systems like the Internet. Scientific applications that stream multimedia include remote computational steering of visualization data and video-on-demand teleconferencing over the Access Grid. However UDP does not possess a self-regulating congestion-control mechanism and most best-effort traffic is served by congestion-controlled TCP. Consequently UDP steals bandwidth from TCP such that TCP flows starve for network resources. With the volume of Internet traffic continuing to increase the perpetuation of UDP-based streaming will cause the Internet to collapse as it did in the mid-1980's due to the use of non-congestion-controlled TCP. To address this problem we introduce the counter-intuitive notion of inter-packet spacing with control feedback to enable UDP-based applications to perform well in the next-generation Internet and computational grids. When compared with traditional UDP-based streaming we illustrate that our approach can reduce packet loss over 50 without adversely affecting delivered throughput,"['streaming multimedia', 'UDP', 'distributed systems', 'Internet', 'remote computational steering', 'visualization data', 'inter-packet spacing', 'UDP-based streaming', 'network protocol', 'transport protocols', 'multimedia communication', 'transport protocols']",161,12
1048,1208,A Virtual Test Facility for the simulation of dynamic response in materials The Center for Simulating Dynamic Response of Materials at the California Institute of Technology is constructing a virtual shock physics facility for studying the response of various target materials to very strong shocks. The Virtual Test Facility VTF is an end-to-end fully three-dimensional simulation of the detonation of high explosives HE shock wave propagation solid material response to pressure loading and compressible turbulence. The VTF largely consists of a parallel fluid solver and a parallel solid mechanics package that are coupled together by the exchange of boundary data. The Eulerian fluid code and Lagrangian solid mechanics model interact via a novel approach based on level sets.

1049,1209,High-level language support for user-defined reductions The optimized handling of reductions on parallel supercomputers or clusters of workstations is critical to high performance because reductions are common in scientific codes and a potential source of bottlenecks. Yet in many high-level languages a mechanism for writing efficient reductions remains surprisingly absent. Further when such mechanisms do exist they often do not provide the flexibility a programmer needs to achieve a desirable level of performance. In this paper we present a new language construct for arbitrary reductions that lets a programmer achieve a level of performance equal to that achievable with the highly flexible but low-level combination of Fortran and MPI. We have implemented this construct in the ZPL language and evaluate it in the context of the initialization of the NAS MG benchmark. We show a 45 times speedup over the same code written in ZPL without this construct. In addition performance on a large number of processors surpasses that achieved in the NAS implementation showing that our mechanism provides programmers with the needed flexibility,"['parallel supercomputers', 'clusters of workstations', 'reductions', 'parallel programming', 'scientific computing', 'language construct', 'parallel languages', 'parallel programming', 'program compilers']",174,9
1050,1210,"Adaptive optimizing compilers for the 21st century Historically compilers have operated by applying a fixed set of optimizations in a predetermined order. We call such an ordered list of optimizations a compilation sequence. This paper describes a prototype system that uses biased random search to discover a program-specific compilation sequence that minimizes an explicit external objective function. The result is a compiler framework that adapts its behavior to the application being compiled to the pool of available transformations to the objective function and to the target machine. This paper describes experiments that attempt to characterize the space that the adaptive compiler must search. The preliminary results suggest that optimal solutions are rare and that local minima are frequent. If this holds true biased random searches such as a,genetic algorithm should find good solutions more quickly than simpler strategies such as hill climbing","['compilers', 'optimizations', 'compilation sequence', 'adaptive compiler', 'optimizing compilers', 'biased random search', 'configurable compilers', 'optimising compilers']",142,8
1051,1211,Hybrid decision tree In this paper a hybrid learning approach named hybrid decision tree HDT is proposed. HDT simulates human reasoning by using symbolic learning to do qualitative analysis and using neural learning to do subsequent quantitative analysis. It generates the trunk of a binary HDT according to the binary information gain ratio criterion in an instance space defined by only original unordered attributes. If unordered attributes cannot further distinguish training examples falling into a leaf node whose diversity is beyond the diversity-threshold then the node is marked as a dummy node. After all those dummy nodes are marked a specific feedforward neural network named FANNC that is trained in an instance space defined by only original ordered attributes is exploited to accomplish the learning task. Moreover this paper distinguishes three kinds of incremental learning tasks. Two incremental learning procedures designed for example-incremental learning with different storage requirements are provided which enables HDT to deal gracefully with data sets where new data are frequently appended. Also a hypothesis-driven constructive induction mechanism is provided which enables HDT to generate compact concept descriptions,"['hybrid decision tree', 'hybrid learning approach', 'reasoning', 'symbolic learning', 'qualitative analysis', 'neural learning', 'quantitative analysis', 'binary information gain ratio criterion', 'feedforward neural network', 'FANNC', 'incremental learning', 'storage requirements', 'data sets', 'hypothesis-driven constructive induction', 'decision trees', 'feedforward neural nets', 'inference mechanisms', 'knowledge acquisition', 'learning (artificial intelligence)']",181,19
1052,1212,TCRM diagnosing tuple inconsistency for granulized datasets Many approaches to granularization have been presented for knowledge discovery. However the inconsistent tuples that exist in granulized datasets are hardly ever revealed. We developed a model tuple consistency recognition model TCRM to help efficiently detect inconsistent tuples for datasets that are granulized. The main outputs of the developed model include explored inconsistent tuples and consumed processing time. We further conducted an empirical test where eighteen continuous real-life datasets granulized by the equal width interval technique that embedded S-plus histogram binning algorithm SHBA and largest binning size algorithm LBSA binning algorithms were diagnosed. Remarkable results almost 40 of the granulized datasets contain inconsistent tuples and 22 have the amount of inconsistent tuples more than 20,"['TCRM', 'tuple inconsistency', 'granulized datasets', 'granularization', 'knowledge discovery', 'tuple consistency recognition model', 'relational database', 'large database', 'processing time', 'equal width interval technique', 'S-plus histogram binning algorithm', 'largest binning size algorithm', 'SQL', 'data integrity', 'data mining', 'relational databases', 'SQL', 'very large databases']",122,18
1053,1213,A knowledge intensive multi-agent framework for cooperative/collaborative design modeling and decision support of assemblies Multi-agent modeling has emerged as a promising discipline for dealing with the decision making process in distributed information system applications. One of such applications is the modeling of distributed design or manufacturing processes which can link up various designs or manufacturing processes to form a virtual consortium on a global basis. This paper proposes a novel knowledge intensive multi-agent cooperative/collaborative framework for concurrent intelligent design and assembly planning which integrates product design design for assembly assembly planning assembly system design and assembly simulation subjected to econo-technical evaluations. An AI protocol based method is proposed to facilitate the integration of intelligent agents for assembly design planning evaluation and simulation processes. A unified class of knowledge intensive Petri nets is defined using the OO knowledge-based Petri net approach and used as an AI protocol for handling both the integration and the negotiation problems among multi-agents. The detailed cooperative/collaborative mechanism and algorithms are given based on the knowledge object cooperation formalisms. As such the assembly-oriented design system can easily be implemented under the multi-agent-based knowledge-intensive Petri net framework with concurrent integration of multiple cooperative knowledge sources and software. Thus product design and assembly planning can be carried out simultaneously and intelligently in an entirely computer-aided concurrent design and assembly planning system,"['knowledge intensive multi-agent framework', 'collaborative design modeling', 'decision support', 'distributed information system applications', 'distributed design', 'virtual consortium', 'cooperative framework', 'concurrent intelligent design', 'assembly planning', 'product design', 'design for assembly', 'assembly simulation', 'AI protocol', 'knowledge intensive Petri nets', 'agent negotiation', 'knowledge object cooperation', 'assembly planning', 'CAD/CAM', 'concurrent engineering', 'decision support systems', 'intelligent design assistants', 'multi-agent systems', 'Petri nets']",222,23

This dynamism is manifested in the form of changing process requirements and time constraints. However current workflow management technologies have difficulties trying to solve problems such as how to deal with the dynamic nature of B2B commerce processes how to manage the distributed knowledge and recourses and how to reduce the transaction risk.

The knowledge flow can carry and accumulate knowledge when it goes through from one team member to another.

1057,1217,A knowledge-based approach for managing urban infrastructures This paper presents a knowledge e-based approach dedicated to the efficient management regulation interactive and dynamic monitoring of urban infrastructures. This approach identifies the data and related treatments common to several municipal activities and defines the requirements and functionalities of the computer tools developed to improve the delivery and coordination of municipal services to the population. The resulting cooperative system called SIGIU is composed of a set of integrated operating systems SYDEX and the global planning and coordination system SYGEC). The objective is to integrate the set of SYDEX and the SYGEC into a single coherent system for all the SIGIU's users according to their tasks their roles and their responsibilities within the municipal administration. SIGIU is provided by different measurement and monitoring instruments installed on some system's elements to be supervised. In this context the information can be presented in different forms video pictures data and alarms. One of SIGIU's objectives is the real-time management of urban infrastructures control mechanisms. To carry out this process the alarm control agent creates a mobile agent associated with the alarm which is sent to a mobile station and warns an operator.

1058,1218,Knowledge acquisition for expert systems in accounting and financial problem domains Since the mid-1980s expert systems have been developed for a variety of problems in accounting and finance. The most commonly cited problems in developing these systems are the unavailability of the experts and knowledge engineers and difficulties with the rule extraction process. Within the field of artificial intelligence this has been called the knowledge acquisition KA problem and has been identified as a major bottleneck in the expert system development process. Recent empirical research reveals that certain KA techniques are significantly more efficient than others in helping to extract certain types of knowledge within specific problem domains. This paper presents a mapping between these empirical studies and a generic taxonomy of expert system problem domains. To accomplish this we first examine the range of problem domains and suggest a mapping of accounting and finance tasks to a generic problem domain taxonomy. We then identify and describe the most prominent KA techniques employed in developing expert systems in accounting and finance. After examining and summarizing the existing empirical KA work we conclude by showing how the empirical KA research in the various problem domains can be used to provide guidance to developers of expert systems in the fields of accounting and finance,"['knowledge acquisition', 'expert systems', 'accounting', 'finance', 'rule extraction process', 'artificial intelligence', 'problem domain taxonomy', 'expert systems', 'financial data processing', 'knowledge acquisition']",212,10

1062,1222,Mining the optimal class association rule set We define an optimal class association rule set to be the minimum rule set with the same predictive power of the complete class association rule set. Using this rule set instead of the complete class association rule set we can avoid redundant computation that would otherwise be required for mining predictive association rules and hence improve the efficiency of the mining process significantly. We present an efficient algorithm for mining the optimal class association rule set using an upward closure property of pruning weak rules before they are actually generated. We have implemented the algorithm and our experimental results show that our algorithm generates the optimal class association rule set whose size is smaller than 1/17 of the complete class association rule set on average in significantly less time than generating the complete class association rule set. Our proposed criterion has been shown very effective for pruning weak rules in dense databases,"['optimal class association rule set mining', 'minimum rule set', 'predictive power', 'redundant computation', 'predictive association rules', 'relational database', 'upward closure property', 'data mining', 'weak rule pruning', 'experimental results', 'dense databases', 'data mining', 'relational databases', 'very large databases']",159,14
1063,1223,Formalising optimal feature weight setting in case based diagnosis as linear programming problems Many approaches to case based reasoning CBR exploit feature weight setting algorithms to reduce the sensitivity to distance functions. We demonstrate that optimal feature weight setting in a special kind of CBR problems can be formalised as linear programming problems. Therefore the optimal weight settings can be calculated in polynomial time instead of searching in exponential weight space using heuristics to get sub-optimal settings. We also demonstrate that our approach can be used to solve classification problems,"['optimal feature weight setting', 'case based diagnosis', 'linear programming', 'case based reasoning', 'distance functions', 'polynomial time', 'searching', 'exponential weight space', 'classification', 'heuristics', 'case-based reasoning', 'classification', 'computational complexity', 'diagnostic reasoning', 'linear programming']",90,15
1064,1224,Formalization of weighted factors analysis Weighted factors analysis WeFA has been proposed as a new approach for elicitation representation and manipulation of knowledge about a given problem generally at a high and strategic level. Central to this proposal is that a group of experts in the area of the problem can identify a hierarchy of factors with positive or negative influences on the problem outcome. The tangible output of WeFA is a directed weighted graph called a WeFA graph. This is a set of nodes denoting factors that can directly or indirectly influence an overall aim of the graph. The aim is also represented by a node. Each directed arc is a direct influence of one factor on another. A chain of directed arcs indicates an indirect influence. The influences may be identified as either positive or negative. For example sales and costs are two factors that influence the aim of profitability in an organization. Sales has a positive influence on profitability and costs has a negative influence on profitability. In addition the relative significance of each influence is represented by a weight. We develop Binary WeFA which is a variant of WeFA where the factors in the graph are restricted to being either true or false. Imposing this restriction on a WeFA graph allows us to be more precise about the meaning of the graph and of reasoning in it. Binary WeFA is a new proposal that provides a formal yet sufficiently simple language for logic-based argumentation for use by business people in decision-support and knowledge management. Whilst Binary WeFA is expressively simpler than other logic-based argumentation formalisms it does incorporate a novel formalization of the notion of significance,"['weighted factors analysis', 'knowledge elicitation', 'knowledge representation', 'knowledge manipulation', 'significance', 'WeFA graph', 'directed arc', 'profitability', 'organization', 'Binary WeFA', 'reasoning', 'logic-based argumentation', 'decision-support', 'knowledge management', 'directed weighted graph', 'business data processing', 'directed graphs', 'formal logic', 'inference mechanisms', 'knowledge acquisition', 'knowledge representation']",280,21

1071,1231,Efficient parallel programming on scalable shared memory systems with High Performance Fortran OpenMP offers a high-level interface for parallel programming on scalable shared memory SMP architectures. It provides the user with simple work-sharing directives while it relies on the compiler to generate parallel programs based on thread parallelism. However the lack of language features for exploiting data locality often results in poor performance since the non-uniform memory access times on scalable SMP machines cannot be neglected. High Performance Fortran HPF the de-facto standard for data parallel programming offers a rich set of data distribution directives in order to exploit data locality but it has been mainly targeted towards distributed memory machines. In this paper we describe an optimized execution model for HPF programs on SMP machines that avails itself with mechanisms provided by OpenMP for work sharing and thread parallelism while exploiting data locality based on user-specified distribution directives. Data locality does not only ensure that most memory accesses are close to the executing threads and are therefore faster but it also minimizes synchronization overheads especially in the case of unstructured reductions. The proposed shared memory execution model for HPF relies on a small set of language extensions which resemble the OpenMP work-sharing features. These extensions together with an optimized shared memory parallelization and execution model have been implemented in the ADAPTOR HPF compilation system and experimental results verify the efficiency of the chosen approach,"['parallel programming', 'scalable shared memory', 'High Performance Fortran', 'multiprocessor architectures', 'scalable hardware', 'shared memory multiprocessor', 'FORTRAN', 'parallel programming', 'shared memory systems']",235,9
1072,1232,Techniques for compiling and implementing all NAS parallel benchmarks in HPF The NAS parallel benchmarks NPB are a well-known benchmark set for high-performance machines. Much effort has been made to implement them in High-Performance Fortran HPF). In previous attempts however the HPF versions did not include the complete set of benchmarks and the performance was not always good. In this study we implement all eight benchmarks of the NPB in HPF and parallelize them using an HPF compiler that we have developed. This report describes the implementation techniques and compiler features necessary to achieve good performance. We evaluate the HPF version on the Hitachi SR2201 a distributed-memory parallel machine. With 16 processors the execution time of the HPF version is within a factor of 1.5 of the hand-parallelized version of the NPB 2.3 beta,"['NAS parallel benchmarks', 'high-performance machines', 'compiler', 'distributed-memory parallel supercomputers', 'HPF compiler', 'FORTRAN', 'parallel programming', 'parallelising compilers', 'performance evaluation']",134,9
1073,1233,Advanced optimization strategies in the Rice dHPF compiler High-Performance Fortran HPF was envisioned as a vehicle for modernizing legacy Fortran codes to achieve scalable parallel performance. To a large extent today's commercially available HPF compilers have failed to deliver scalable parallel performance for a broad spectrum of applications because of insufficiently powerful compiler analysis and optimization. Substantial restructuring and hand-optimization can be required to achieve acceptable performance with an HPF port of an existing Fortran application even for regular data-parallel applications. A key goal of the Rice dHPF compiler project has been to develop optimization techniques that enable a wide range of existing scientific applications to be ported easily to efficient HPF with minimal restructuring. This paper describes the challenges to effective parallelization presented by complex but regular data-parallel applications and then describes how the novel analysis and optimization technologies in the dHPF compiler address these challenges effectively without major rewriting of the applications. We illustrate the techniques by describing their use for parallelizing the NAS SP and BT benchmarks. The dHPF compiler generates multipartitioned parallelizations of these codes that are approaching the scalability and efficiency of sophisticated hand-coded parallelizations,"['Mgh-Performance Fortran', 'legacy Fortran codes', 'parallel performance', 'HPF compilers', 'compiler analysis', 'compiler optimization', 'Rice dHPF compiler', 'multipartitioning', 'automatic parallelization', 'FORTRAN', 'optimising compilers', 'parallelising compilers']",190,12
1074,1234,Achieving performance under OpenMP on ccNUMA and software distributed shared memory systems OpenMP is emerging as a viable high-level programming model for shared memory parallel systems. It was conceived to enable easy portable application development on this range of systems and it has also been implemented on cache-coherent Non-Uniform Memory Access ccNUMA architectures. Unfortunately it is hard to obtain high performance on the latter architecture particularly when large numbers of threads are involved. In this paper we discuss the difficulties faced when writing OpenMP programs for ccNUMA systems and explain how the vendors have attempted to overcome them. We focus on one such system the SGI Origin 2000 and perform a variety of experiments designed to illustrate the impact of the vendor's efforts. We compare codes written in a standard loop-level parallel style under OpenMP with alternative versions written in a Single Program Multiple Data SPMD fashion also realized via OpenMP and show that the latter consistently provides superior performance. A carefully chosen set of language extensions can help us translate programs from the former style to the latter or to compile directly but in a similar manner). Syntax for these extensions can be borrowed from HPF and some aspects of HPF compiler technology can help the translation process. It is our expectation that an extended language if well compiled would improve the attractiveness of OpenMP as a language for high-performance computation on an important class of modern architectures,"['cache-coherent Non-Uniform Memory Access', 'OpenMP', 'programming model', 'shared memory parallel systems', 'HPF', 'Single Program Multiple Data', 'parallel programming', 'distributed shared memory systems', 'parallel programming', 'software performance evaluation']",239,10
1075,1235,Finding performance bugs with the TNO HPF benchmark suite High-Performance Fortran HPF has been designed to provide portable performance on distributed memory machines. An important aspect of portable performance is the behavior of the available HPF compilers. Ideally a programmer may expect comparable performance between different HPF compilers given the same program and the same machine. To test the performance portability between compilers we have designed a special benchmark suite called the TNO HPF benchmark suite. It consists of a set of HPF programs that test various aspects of efficient parallel code generation. The benchmark suite consists of a number of template programs that are used to generate test programs with different array sizes alignments distributions and iteration spaces. It ranges from very simple assignments to more complex assignments such as triangular iteration spaces convex iteration spaces coupled subscripts and indirection arrays. We have run the TNO HPF benchmark suite on three compilers the PREPARE prototype compiler the PGI-HPF compiler and the GMD Adaptor HPF compiler. Results show performance differences that can be quite large up to two orders of magnitude for the same test program). Closer inspection reveals that the origin of most of the differences in performance is due to differences in local enumeration and storage of distributed array elements,"['High-Performance Fortran', 'portable performance', 'distributed memory machines', 'HPF compilers', 'performance portability', 'benchmark suite', 'parallel compilers', 'compiler optimizations', 'FORTRAN', 'parallel programming', 'program compilers', 'software performance evaluation', 'software portability']",212,13
1076,1236,Compatibility comparison and performance evaluation for Japanese HPF compilers using scientific applications The lack of compatibility of High-Performance Fortran HPF between vender implementations has been disheartening scientific application users so as to hinder the development of portable programs. Thus parallel computing is still unpopular in the computational science community even though parallel programming is common to the computer science community. As users would like to run the same source code on parallel machines with different architectures as fast as possible we have investigated the compatibility of source codes for Japanese HPF compilers NEC Fujitsu and Hitachi with two real-world applications a 3D fluid code and a 2D particle code. We have found that the source-level compatibility between Japanese HPF compilers is almost preserved but more effort will be needed to sustain complete compatibility. We have also evaluated parallel performance and found that HPF can achieve good performance for the 3D fluid code with almost the same source code. For the 2D particle code good results have also been obtained with a small number of processors but some changes in the original source code and the addition of interface blocks is required,"['High-Performance Fortran', 'HPF', 'source compatability', 'portable programs', 'parallel programming', 'compilers', 'parallel performance', 'FORTRAN', 'parallel programming', 'program compilers', 'software performance evaluation', 'software portability']",191,12
1077,1237,High-performance numerical pricing methods The pricing of financial derivatives is an important field in finance and constitutes a major component of financial management applications. The uncertainty of future events often makes analytic approaches infeasible and hence time-consuming numerical simulations are required. In the Aurora Financial Management System pricing is performed on the basis of lattice representations of stochastic multidimensional scenario processes using the Monte Carlo simulation and Backward Induction methods the latter allowing for the exploitation of shared-memory parallelism. We present the parallelization of a Backward Induction numerical pricing kernel on a cluster of SMPs using HPF+ an extended version of High-Performance Fortran. Based on language extensions for specifying a hierarchical mapping of data onto an SMP cluster the compiler generates a hybrid-parallel program combining distributed-memory and shared-memory parallelism.

In particular this paper describes four of them 1 the ON directive of HPF 2.0 2 the REFLECT and LOCAL directives of HPF/JA 3 vectorization directives and 4 automatic parallelization. We evaluate these features through some benchmark programs on NEC SX-5. The results show that each of them achieved a 5-8 times speedup in 8-CPU parallel execution and the four features are useful for vector parallel execution. We also evaluate the overall performance of HPF/SX V2 by using over 30 well-known benchmark programs from HPFBench APR Benchmarks GENESIS Benchmarks and NAS Parallel Benchmarks. About half of the programs showed good performance while the other half suggest weakness of the compiler especially on its runtimes. It is necessary to improve them to put the compiler to practical use,"['HPF/SX V2', 'High Performance Fortran compiler', 'vector parallel machines', 'benchmark', 'parallelization', 'compiler', 'FORTRAN', 'parallel languages', 'parallelising compilers']",163,9
1081,1241,Code generator for the HPF Library and Fortran 95 transformational functions One of the language features of the core language of HPF 2.0 High Performance Fortran is the HPF Library. The HPF Library consists of 55 generic functions. The implementation of this library presents the challenge that all data types data kinds array ranks and input distributions need to be supported. For instance more than 2 billion separate functions are required to support COPY-SCATTER fully. The efficient support of these billions of specific functions is one of the outstanding problems of HPF. We have solved this problem by developing a library generator which utilizes the mechanism of parameterized templates. This mechanism allows the procedures to be instantiated at compile time for arguments with a specific type kind rank and distribution over a specific processor array. We describe the algorithms used in the different library functions. The implementation gives the ease of generating a large number of library routines from a single template. The templates can be extended with special code for specific combinations of the input arguments. We describe in detail the implementation and performance of the matrix multiplication template for the Fujitsu VPP5000 platform,"['HPF', 'High Performance Fortran', 'HPF Library', 'generic functions', 'data types', 'library generator', 'library functions', 'parallel computing', 'parallel languages', 'code generation', 'parameterized templates', 'matrix multiplication', 'FORTRAN', 'matrix multiplication', 'parallel languages', 'parallel programming', 'software libraries']",195,17
1082,1242,VPP Fortran and the design of HPF/JA extensions VPP Fortran is a data parallel language that has been designed for the VPP series of supercomputers. In addition to pure data parallelism it contains certain low-level features that were designed to extract high performance from user programs. A comparison of VPP Fortran and High-Performance Fortran HPF 2.0 shows that these low-level features are not available in HPF 2.0. The features include asynchronous interprocessor communication explicit shadow and the LOCAL directive. They were shown in VPP Fortran to be very useful in handling real-world applications and they have been included in the HPF/JA extensions. They are described in the paper. The HPF/JA Language Specification Version 1.0 is an extension of HPF 2.0 to achieve practical performance for real-world applications and is a result of collaboration in the Japan Association for HPF JAHPF). Some practical programming and tuning procedures with the HPF/JA Language Specification are described using the NAS Parallel Benchmark BT as an example,"['VPP Fortran', 'data parallel language', 'data parallelism', 'high performance', 'asynchronous interprocessor communication', 'explicit shadow', 'benchmark', 'asynchronous communication', 'data locality', 'FORTRAN', 'parallel languages']",162,11
1083,1243,HPF/JA extensions of High Performance Fortran for accelerating real-world applications This paper presents a set of extensions on High Performance Fortran HPF to make it more usable for parallelizing real-world production codes. HPF has been effective for programs that a compiler can automatically optimize efficiently. However once the compiler cannot there have been no ways for the users to explicitly parallelize or optimize their programs. In order to resolve the situation we have developed a set of HPF extensions HPF/JA to give the users more control over sophisticated parallelization and communication optimizations. They include parallelization of loops with complicated reductions asynchronous communication user-controllable shadow and communication pattern reuse for irregular remote data accesses. Preliminary experiments have proved that the extensions are effective at increasing HPF's usability,"['High Performance Fortran', 'HPF', 'parallel processing', 'compiler', 'data parallel language', 'supercomputer', 'parallelization of loops', 'parallel programming', 'FORTRAN', 'parallelising compilers']",126,10
1084,1244,Applied ethics in business information units The primary thesis of this paper is that business information professionals commonly overlook ethical dilemmas in the workplace. Although the thesis remains unproven the author highlights by way of real and hypothetical case studies a number of situations in which ethical tensions can be identified and suggests that information professionals need to be more aware of the moral context of their actions. Resolving ethical dilemmas should be one of the aims of competent information professionals and their managers although it is recognized that dilemmas often cannot easily be resolved. A background to the main theories of applied ethics forms the framework for later discussion,"['business information professionals', 'ethical dilemmas', 'moral context', 'applied ethics', 'business information units', 'information industry', 'information science', 'professional aspects']",110,8

1086,1246,Why information departments are becoming academic This article outlines the increasing convergence between academia and business over the last decade or so and the mutual benefits that this closer association has brought. It also looks at the growing importance of the information profession suggesting that this is leading to a greater need for specialist skills as reflected by the rise in academic courses in this area. However it argues that increasing specialization must not lead to insularity if information professionals are truly concerned with gaining a competitive advantage they must not close their minds to the potential benefits of working with external non specialist partners. The benefits that business has reaped from academia it is contended suggest that this may also be a fruitful avenue for information departments to explore,"['information science', 'universities', 'academia', 'business', 'information profession', 'specialist skills', 'academic courses', 'information departments', 'commerce', 'educational administrative data processing', 'educational courses', 'information science', 'professional aspects']",130,13
1087,1247,The changing landscape for multi access portals Discusses the factors that have made life difficult for consumer portal operators in recent years causing them like others in the telecommunications media and technology sector to take a close look at their business models following the dot.com crash and the consequent reassessment of Internet-related project financing by the venture capital community. While the pressure is on to generate income from existing customers and users portal operators must reach new markets and find realistic revenue streams. This search for real revenues has led to a move towards charging for content a strategy being pursued by a large number of horizontal portal players including MSN and Terra Lycos. This trend is particularly noticeable in China where Chinadotcom operates a mainland portal and plans a range of fee-based services including electronic mail. The nature of advertising itself is changing with portals seeking blue-chip sponsorship and marketing deals that span a number of years. Players are struggling to redefine and reinvent themselves as a result of the changing environment and even the term portal is believed to be obsolete partly due to its dot.com crash associations. Multi-access portals are expected to dominate the consumer sector becoming bigger and better overall than their predecessors and playing a more powerful role in the consumer environment,"['multi-access portals', 'consumer portal operators', 'revenue streams', 'fee-based services', 'advertising', 'blue-chip sponsorship', 'information industry', 'information resources', 'Internet', 'management of change', 'online front-ends', 'search engines']",217,12

1092,1252,An agent-oriented and service-oriented environment for deploying dynamic distributed systems This paper presents JASE a Java-based Agent-oriented and Service-oriented Environment for deploying dynamic distributed systems. JASE utilizes two important concepts in the field of distributed computing the concept of services and remote programming with mobile agents. In JASE mobile agents are used to support applications and service interface agents are used to wrap services. Service inter-face agents can dynamically register their services in Service Server. Mobile agent locates a specific service interface agent by submitting requests to the Service Server with descriptions of required services. JASE uses XML to describe both service descriptions and the mobile agent's queries. JASE supports two kinds of communication facility tuple space and asynchronous messages.

1094,1254,Supporting unified interface to wrapper generator in integrated information retrieval Given the ever-increasing scale and diversity of information and applications on the Internet improving the technology of information retrieval is an urgent research objective. Retrieved information is either semi-structured or unstructured in format and its sources are extremely heterogeneous. In consequence the task of efficiently gathering and extracting information from documents can be both difficult and tedious. Given this variety of sources and formats many choose to use mediator/wrapper architecture but its use demands a fast means of generating efficient wrappers. In this paper we present a design for an automatic eXtensible Markup Language XML)-based framework with which to generate wrappers rapidly. Wrappers created with this framework support a unified interface for a meta-search information retrieval system based on the Internet Search Service using the Common Object Request Broker Architecture CORBA standard. Greatly advantaged by the compatibility of CORBA and XML a user can quickly and easily develop information-gathering applications such as a meta-search engine or any other information source retrieval method. The two main things our design provides are a method of wrapper generation that is fast simple and efficient and a wrapper generator that is CORBA and XML-compliant and that supports a unified interface,"['unified interface', 'wrapper generator', 'integrated information retrieval', 'Internet', 'automatic eXtensible Markup Language', 'CORBA', 'meta-search engine', 'distributed object management', 'hypermedia markup languages', 'information retrieval', 'pattern matching']",206,11
1095,1255,Succession in standardization grafting XML onto SGML Succession in standardization is often a problem. The advantages of improvements must be weighed against those of compatibility. If compatibility considerations dominate a grafting process takes place. According to our taxonomy of succession there are three types of outcomes. A Type I succession where grafting is successful entails compatibility between successors technical paradigm compliance and continuity in the standards trajectory. In this paper we examine issues of succession and focus on the Extensible Markup Language XML). It was to be grafted on the Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML a stable standard since 1988. However XML was a profile a subset and an extension of SGML 1988). Adaptation of SGML was needed SGML 1999 to forge full downward compatibility with XML 1998). We describe the grafting efforts and analyze their outcomes. Our conclusion is that although SGML was a technical exemplar for XML developers full compatibility was not achieved. The widespread use of HyperText Mark-up Language HTML exemplified the desirability of simplicity in XML standardization. This and HTML's user market largely explain the discontinuity in SGML-XML succession,"['XML', 'SGML', 'standardization', 'grafting process', 'Type I succession', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Standard Generalized Markup Language', 'hypermedia markup languages', 'page description languages', 'standardisation']",183,10
1096,1256,High-speed consistency checking for hypothetical reasoning systems using inference path network Hypothetical reasoning is popular in fault diagnostics and design systems but slow reasoning speed is its drawback. The goal of the current study is developing hypothetical reasoning based on an inference path network which would overcome this drawback. In hypothetical reasoning systems based on an inference path network there is much room for improvement regarding the computing costs of connotation processing and consistency checking. The authors of this study demonstrate improvement ideas regarding one of these problems namely consistency checking. First the authors obtained necessary and sufficient conditions under which inconsistencies occur during hypothesis composition. Based on the obtained results the authors proposed an algorithm for speeding up the process of consistency checking. Processing with this algorithm in its core consists of transforming the inference path network in such a way that inconsistencies do not occur during the hypothesis composition under the condition of unchanged solution hypotheses. The efficiency of this algorithm was confirmed by tests,"['hypothetical reasoning', 'fault diagnostics', 'high-speed consistency checking', 'inference path network', 'reasoning speed', 'inconsistencies', 'hypothesis composition', 'speed up', 'diagnostic reasoning', 'heuristic programming', 'uncertainty handling']",167,11
1097,1257,Definition of a similarity measure between cases based on auto/cross-fuzzy thesauri A similarity measure between cases is needed in order to evaluate the degree of similarity when using past similar cases in order to resolve current problems. In similar case retrieval multiple indices are set up in order to characterize the queries and individual cases then terms are given as values to each. The similarity measure between cases commonly used is defined using the rate at which the values provided from the corresponding indices match. In practice however values cannot be expected to be mutually exclusive. As a result a natural expansion of this approach is to have relationships in which mutually similar meanings are reflected in the similarity measure between cases. In this paper the authors consider an auto-fuzzy thesaurus which gives the relationship for values between corresponding indices and a cross-fuzzy thesaurus which gives the relationship for values between mutually distinct indices then defines a similarity measure between cases which considers the relationship of index values based on these thesauri. This definition satisfies the characteristics required for the operation of case-based retrieval even when one value is not necessarily given in the index. Finally using a test similar case retrieval system the authors perform a comparative analysis of the proposed similarity measure between cases and a conventional approach,"['case similarity measure', 'relationship indices', 'corresponding indices', 'mutually distinct indices', 'case-based retrieval', 'decision making support system', 'problem solving', 'similar case retrieval', 'auto-fuzzy thesaurus', 'cross-fuzzy thesaurus', 'case-based reasoning', 'decision support systems', 'fuzzy logic', 'indexing', 'problem solving', 'thesauri']",220,16
1098,1258,Implementation and performance evaluation of a FIFO queue class library for time warp The authors describe the implementation use and performance evaluation of a FIFO queue class library by means of a high-performance easy-to-use interface employed for queuing simulations in parallel discrete simulations based on the time warp method. Various general-purpose simulation libraries and languages have been proposed and among these some have the advantage of not requiring users to define anything other than the state vector and not needing awareness of rollback under a platform which performs state control based on copies. However because the state vectors must be defined as simple data structures without pointers dynamic data structures such as a FIFO queue cannot be handled directly. Under the proposed class library both the platform and the user can handle such structures in the same fashion that embedded data structures are handled. In addition instead of all stored data just the operational history can be stored and recovered efficiently at an effectively minimal cost by taking advantage of the first-in-first-out characteristics of the above data structures. When the kernel deletes past state histories during a simulation garbage collection is also performed transparently using the corresponding method,"['FIFO queue', 'class library', 'time warp simulation', 'performance evaluation', 'easy-to-use interface', 'queuing simulations', 'parallel discrete simulations', 'general-purpose simulation libraries', 'simulation languages', 'state vectors', 'dynamic data structures', 'embedded data structures', 'operational history', 'first-in-first-out characteristics', 'garbage collection', 'object oriented method', 'state management', 'data structures', 'object-oriented programming', 'queueing theory', 'simulation languages', 'software libraries', 'software performance evaluation', 'storage management', 'time warp simulation']",198,25
1099,1259,A mechanism for inferring approximate solutions under incomplete knowledge based on rule similarity This paper proposes an inference method which can obtain an approximate solution even if the knowledge stored in the problem-solving system is incomplete. When a rule needed for solving the problem does not exist the problem can be solved by using rules similar to the existing rules. In an implementation using the SLD procedure a resolution is executed between a subgoal and a rule if an atom of the subgoal is similar to the consequence atom of the rule. Similarities between atoms are calculated using a knowledge base of words with account of the reasoning situation and the reliability of the derived solution is calculated based on these similarities. If many solutions are obtained they are grouped into classes of similar solutions and a representative solution is then selected for each class. The proposed method was verified experimentally by solving simple problems,"['inference method', 'approximate solution', 'incomplete knowledge', 'rule similarity', 'problem solving', 'SLD procedure', 'subgoal atom', 'consequence atom', 'word knowledge base', 'reasoning', 'reliability', 'representative solution', 'common sense knowledge', 'common-sense reasoning', 'knowledge based systems', 'knowledge representation', 'problem solving', 'uncertainty handling']",155,18

1101,1261,Topology-adaptive modeling of objects using surface evolutions based on 3D mathematical morphology Level set methods were proposed mainly by mathematicians for constructing a model of a 3D object of arbitrary topology. However those methods are computationally inefficient due to repeated distance transformations and increased dimensions. In the paper we propose a new method of modeling fast objects of arbitrary topology by using a surface evolution approach based on mathematical morphology. Given sensor data covering the whole object surface the method begins with an initial approximation of the object by evolving a closed surface into a model topologically equivalent to the real object. The refined approximation is then performed using energy minimization. The method has been applied in several experiments using range data and the results are reported in the paper,"['level set methods', 'topology-adaptive modeling', 'surface evolutions', '3D mathematical morphology', '3D object', 'arbitrary topology', 'repeated distance transformations', 'initial approximation', 'refined approximation', 'energy minimization', 'range data', 'pseudo curvature flow', 'approximation theory', 'curvature measurement', 'distance measurement', 'image processing', 'mathematical morphology', 'minimisation', 'set theory', 'topology']",130,20

1104,1264,Estimation of the vanishing point for automatic driving system using a cross ratio This paper proposes a new method to estimate the vanishing point used as the vehicle heading which is essential in automatic driving systems. The proposed method uses a cross ratio comprised of a ratio of lengths from four collinear points for extracting the edges that shape the vanishing point. Then lines that intersect at one point are fitted to the edges in a Hough space. Consequently the vanishing point is estimated robustly even when the lane markings are occluded by other vehicles. In the presence of lane markings the road boundaries are also estimated at the same time. Experimental results from images of a real road scene show the effectiveness of the proposed method,"['vanishing point estimation', 'automatic driving system', 'cross ratio', 'automatic driving systems', 'collinear points', 'Hough space', 'lane markings', 'real road scene', 'driver information systems', 'edge detection', 'feature extraction']",127,11
1105,1265,Optimization of requantization parameter for MPEG transcoding This paper considers transcoding in which an MPEG stream is converted to a low-bit-rate MPEG stream and proposes a method in which the transcoding error can be reduced by optimally selecting the quantization parameter for each macroblock. In transcoding with a low compression ratio it is crucial to prohibit transcoding with a requantization parameter which is 1 to 2 times the quantization parameter of the input stream. Consequently as the first step an optimization method for the requantization parameter is proposed which cares for the error propagation effect by interframe prediction. Then the proposed optimization method is extended so that the method can also be applied to the case of a high compression ratio in which the rate-distortion curve is approximated for each macroblock in the range of requantization parameters larger than 2 times the quantization parameter. It is verified by a simulation experiment that the PSNR is improved by 0.5 to 0.8 dB compared to the case in which a 6 Mbit/s MPEG stream is not optimized by twofold recompression,"['requantization parameter optimization', 'low-bit-rate MPEG stream', 'transcoding error', 'macroblock', 'compression ratio', 'error propagation effect', 'interframe prediction', 'rate-distortion curve', 'PSNR', 'simulation', 'twofold recompression', 'rate conversion', 'rate control', '6 Mbit/s', 'data compression', 'optimisation', 'quantisation (signal)', 'rate distortion theory', 'variable rate codes', 'video coding']",178,20
1106,1266,An intelligent information gathering method for dynamic information mediators The Internet is spreading into our society rapidly and is becoming one of the information infrastructures that are indispensable for our daily life. In particular the WWW is widely used for various purposes such as sharing personal information academic research business work and electronic commerce and the amount of available information is increasing rapidly. We usually utilize information sources on the Internet as individual stand-alone sources but if we can integrate them we can add more value to each of them. Hence information mediators which integrate information distributed on the Internet are drawing attention. In this paper under the assumption that the information sources to be integrated are updated frequently and asynchronously we propose an information gathering method that constructs an answer to a query from a user accessing information sources to be integrated properly within an allowable time period. The proposed method considers the reliability of data in the cache and the quality of answer in order to efficiently access information sources and to provide appropriate answers to the user. As evaluation we show the effectiveness of the proposed method by using an artificial information integration problem in which some parameters can be modified and a real-world flight information service compared with a conventional FIFO information gathering method,"['intelligent information gathering method', 'dynamic information mediators', 'Internet', 'information infrastructures', 'WWW', 'academic research', 'business work', 'electronic commerce', 'artificial information integration problem', 'real-world flight information service', 'information resources', 'Internet', 'software agents']",218,13

First the flow fundamental matrices are optimally computed from the observed flow. They are then decomposed into the focal length its rate of change and the motion parameters. Next the flow is optimally corrected so that it satisfies the epipolar equation exactly. Finally the 3D positions are computed and their covariance matrices are evaluated.

The problem of reachability in such nets consists in finding a sequence of transitions that leads from the initial marking of a given contextual net to a given goal marking. The solution to this problem that is presented in this paper consists in constructing a finite complete prefix of the unfolding of the given contextual net that is a finite prefix in which all the markings that are reachable from the initial marking are present and in searching in each branch of this prefix for the goal marking by solving an appropriate linear programming problem,"['contextual nets reachability', 'Petri nets', 'concurrent systems', 'context dependent actions', 'finite prefix', 'goal marking', 'linear programming', 'formal specification', 'linear programming', 'Petri nets', 'process algebra']",116,11
1109,1269,Minimizing the number of successor states in the stubborn set method Combinatorial explosion which occurs in parallel compositions of LTSs can be alleviated by letting the stubborn set method construct on-the-fly a reduced LTS that is CFFD or CSP-equivalent to the actual parallel composition. This article considers the problem of minimizing the number of successor states of a given state in the reduced LTS. The problem can be solved by constructing an and/or-graph with weighted vertices and by finding a set of vertices that satisfies a certain constraint such that no set of vertices satisfying the constraint has a smaller sum of weights. Without weights the and/or-graph can be constructed in low-degree polynomial time w.r.t. the length of the input of the problem. However since actions can be nondeterministic and transitions can share target states it is not known whether the weights are generally computable in polynomial time. Consequently it is an open problem whether minimizing the number of successor states is as easy as minimizing the number of successor transitions,"['stubborn set method', 'combinatorial explosion', 'weighted vertices', 'low-degree polynomial time', 'CSP-equivalence', 'combinatorial mathematics', 'communicating sequential processes']",171,7

Some research groups used the data completed by RDSS for verifying the utility of chosen methods in volumetric storm cells classification. The paper consists of a review of experiments that were made on the data from RDSS database of Environment Canada and presents the quality of particular classifiers. The classification accuracy coefficient is used to express the quality. For five research groups that led their experiments in a similar way it was possible to compare received outputs. Experiments showed that the support vector machine SVM method and rough set algorithms which use object oriented reducts for rule generation to classify volumetric storm data perform better than other classifiers,"['decision algorithms', 'volumetric storm cells classification', 'meteorological volumetric radar data', 'radar decision support system', 'summer storms', 'classification accuracy', 'support vector machine', 'rough set algorithms', 'object oriented reducts', 'data mining', 'decision support systems', 'meteorological radar', 'pattern recognition']",153,13
1111,1271,Verification of non-functional properties of a composable architecture with Petri nets In this paper we introduce our concept of composability and present the MSS architecture as an example for a composable architecture. MSS claims to be composable with respect to timing properties. We discuss how to model and prove properties in such an architecture with time-extended Petrinets. As a result the first step of a proof of composability is presented as well as a new kind of Petri net which is more suitable for modeling architectures like MSS,"['non-functional properties verification', 'MSS architecture', 'timing properties', 'composable architecture', 'Petri nets', 'proof of composability', 'formal specification', 'formal verification', 'Petri nets']",88,9
1112,1272,Global action rules in distributed knowledge systems Previously Z. Ras and J.M. Zytkow 2000 introduced and investigated query answering system based on distributed knowledge mining. The notion of an action rule was introduced by Z. Ras and A. Wieczorkowska 2000 and its application domain e-business was taken. In this paper we generalize the notion of action rules in a similar way to handling global queries. Mainly when values of attributes for a given customer used in action rules can not be easily changed by business user definitions of these attributes are extracted from other sites of a distributed knowledge system. To be more precise attributes at every site of a distributed knowledge system are divided into two sets stable and flexible. Values of flexible attributes for a given consumer sometime can be changed and this change can be influenced and controlled by a business user. However some of these changes for instance to the attribute profit can not be done directly to a chosen attribute. In this case definitions of such an attribute in terms of other attributes have to be learned. These new definitions are used to construct action rules showing what changes in values of flexible attributes for a given consumer are needed in order to re-classify this consumer the way business user wants. But business user may be either unable or unwilling to proceed with actions leading to such changes. In all such cases we may search for definitions of these flexible attributes looking at either local or remote sites for help,"['global action rules', 'query answering system', 'action rules', 'attributes', 'e-commerce', 'distributed knowledge mining', 'data mining', 'electronic commerce', 'knowledge based systems']",255,9
1113,1273,Towards an ontology of approximate reason This article introduces structural aspects in an ontology of approximate reason. The basic assumption in this ontology is that approximate reason is a capability of an agent. Agents are designed to classify information granules derived from sensors that respond to stimuli in the environment of an agent or received from other agents. Classification of information granules is carried out in the context of parameterized approximation spaces and a calculus of granules. Judgment in agents is a faculty of thinking about classifying the particular relative to decision rules derived from data. Judgment in agents is reflective but not in the classical philosophical sense e.g. the notion of judgment in Kant). In an agent a reflective judgment itself is an assertion that a particular decision rule derived from data is applicable to an object input). That is a reflective judgment by an agent is an assertion that a particular vector of attribute sensor values matches to some degree the conditions for a particular rule. In effect this form of judgment is an assertion that a vector of sensor values reflects a known property of data expressed by a decision rule. Since the reasoning underlying a reflective judgment is inductive and surjective not based on a priori conditions or universals this form of judgment is reflective but not in the sense of Kant. Unlike Kant a reflective judgment is surjective in the sense that it maps experimental attribute values onto the most closely matching descriptors conditions in a derived rule. Again unlike Kant's notion of judgment a reflective judgment is not the result of searching for a universal that pertains to a particular set of values of descriptors. Rather a reflective judgment by an agent is a form of recognition that a particular vector of sensor values pertains to a particular rule in some degree. This recognition takes the form of an assertion that a particular descriptor vector is associated with a particular decision rule. These considerations can be repeated for other forms of classifiers besides those defined by decision rules,"['ontology', 'approximate reason', 'information granules', 'parameterized approximation spaces', 'granules', 'decision rules', 'reflective judgment', 'pattern recognition', 'rough sets', 'inference mechanisms', 'neural nets', 'software agents', 'uncertainty handling']",344,13
1114,1274,Bounded model checking for the universal fragment of CTL Bounded Model Checking BMC has been recently introduced as an efficient verification method for reactive systems. BMC based on SAT methods consists in searching for a counterexample of a particular length and generating a propositional formula that is satisfiable iff such a counterexample-exists. This new technique has been introduced by E. Clarke et al. for model checking of linear time temporal logic LTL). Our paper shows how the concept of bounded model checking can be extended to ACTL the universal fragment of CTL).

An application to modelling protocols with fork-join structures In this paper we discuss possibilities of modelling protocols by objects in object-based high-level Petri nets.

1118,1278,Verification of timed automata based on similarity The paper presents a modification of the standard partitioning technique to generate abstract state spaces preserving similarity for Timed Automata.

1119,1279,Place/Transition Petri net evolutions recording ways analysis and synthesis Four semantic domains for Place/Transition Petri nets and their relationships are considered. They are monoids of respectively firing sequences processes traces and dependence graphs. For each of them the analysis and synthesis problem is stated and solved. The monoid of processes is defined in a non-standard way Nets under consideration involve weights of arrows and capacities finite or infinite of places.

1120,1280,Products and polymorphic subtypes This paper is devoted to a comprehensive study of polymorphic subtypes with products. We first present a sound and complete Hilbert style axiomatization of the relation of being a subtype in presence of to   type constructors and the For all quantifier and we show that such axiornatization is not encodable in the system with to  For all only. In order to give a logical semantics to such a subtyping relation we propose a new form of a sequent which plays a key role in a natural deduction and a Gentzen style calculi. Interestingly enough the sequent must have the form E implies T where E is a non-commutative non-empty sequence of typing assumptions and T is a finite binary tree of typing judgements each of them behaving like a pushdown store. We study basic metamathematical properties of the two logical systems such as subject reduction and cut elimination. Some decidability/undecidability issues related to the presented subtyping relation are also explored as expected the subtyping over to   For all is undecidable being already undecidable for the to  For all fragment as proved in 15 but for the  For all fragment it turns out to be decidable,"['polymorphic subtypes', 'products subtypes', 'Hilbert style axiomatization', 'logical semantics', 'Gentzen style calculi', 'finite binary tree', 'pushdown store', 'metamathernatical properties', 'decidability', 'decidability', 'process algebra', 'semantic networks']",199,12
1121,1281,A notion of non-interference for timed automata The non-interference property of concurrent systems is a security property concerning the flow of information among different levels of security of the system. In this paper we introduce a notion of timed non-interference for real-time systems specified by timed automata. The notion is presented using an automata based approach and then it is characterized also by operations and equivalence between timed languages.

1122,1282,Completeness of timed mu CRL Previously a straightforward extension of the process algebra mu CRL was proposed to explicitly deal with time. The process algebra mu CRL has been especially designed to deal with data in a process algebraic context. Using the features for data only a minor extension of the language was needed to obtain a very expressive variant of time. Previously it contained syntax operational semantics and axioms characterising timed mu CRL. It did not contain an in depth analysis of theory of timed mu CRL. This paper fills this gap by providing soundness and completeness results. The main tool to establish these is a mapping of timed to untimed mu CRL and employing the completeness results obtained for untimed mu CRL,"['timed mu CRL', 'completeness', 'process algebra', 'operational semantics', 'bisimulation equivalence', 'process algebra']",124,6

1125,1285,On fractal dimension in information systems. Toward exact sets in infinite information systems The notions of an exact as well as a rough set are well-grounded as basic notions in rough set theory. They are however defined in the setting of a finite information system i.e. an information system having finite numbers of objects as well as attributes. In theoretical studies e.g. of topological properties of rough sets one has to trespass this limitation and to consider information systems with potentially unbound number of attributes. In such setting the notions of rough and exact sets may be defined in terms of topological operators of interior and closure with respect to an appropriate topology following the ideas from the finite case where it is noticed that in the finite case rough-set-theoretic operators of lower and upper approximation are identical with the interior respectively closure operators in topology induced by equivalence classes of the indiscernibility relation. Extensions of finite information systems are also desirable from application point of view in the area of knowledge discovery and data mining when demands of e.g. mass collaboration and/or huge experimental data call for need of working with large data tables so the sound theoretical generalization of these cases is an information system with the number of attributes not bound in advance by a fixed integer i.e. an information system with countably but infinitely many attributes In large information systems a need arises for qualitative measures of complexity of concepts involved free of parameters cf. e.g. applications for the Vapnik-Czervonenkis dimension. We study here in the theoretical setting of infinite information system a proposal to apply fractal dimensions suitably modified as measures of concept complexity,"['fractal dimension', 'information systems', 'exact sets', 'infinite information systems', 'rough set', 'topological properties', 'closure operators', 'equivalence classes', 'knowledge discovery', 'data mining', 'qualitative measures', 'complexity', 'computational complexity', 'data mining', 'equivalence classes']",279,15

1133,1293,Truss topology optimization by a modified genetic algorithm This paper describes the use of a stochastic search procedure based on genetic algorithms for developing near-optimal topologies of load-bearing truss structures. Most existing cases these publications express the truss topology as a combination of members. These methods however have the disadvantage that the resulting topology may include needless members or those which overlap other members. In addition to these problems the generated structures are not necessarily structurally stable. A new method which resolves these problems by expressing the truss topology as a combination of triangles is proposed in this paper. Details of the proposed methodology are presented as well as the results of numerical examples that clearly show the effectiveness and efficiency of the method,"['stochastic search procedure', 'modified genetic algorithm', 'near-optimal topologies', 'load-bearing truss structures', 'truss topology optimization', 'triangles', 'genetic algorithms', 'structural engineering computing']",124,8

1136,1296,Development of visual design steering as an aid in large-scale multidisciplinary design optimization. I. Method development A modified paradigm of computational steering CS termed visual design steering VDS is developed in this paper. The VDS paradigm is applied to optimal design problems to provide a means for capturing and enabling designer insights. VDS allows a designer to make decisions before during or after an analysis or optimization via a visual environment in order to effectively steer the solution process. The objective of VDS is to obtain a better solution in less time through the use of designer knowledge and expertise. Using visual representations of complex systems in this manner enables human experience and judgement to be incorporated into the optimal design process at appropriate steps rather than having traditional black box solvers return solutions from a prescribed input set. Part I of this paper focuses on the research issues pertaining to the Graph Morphing visualization method created to represent an n-dimensional optimization problem using 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional visualizations. Part II investigates the implementation of the VDS paradigm using the graph morphing approach to improve an optimal design process. Specifically the following issues are addressed impact of design variable changes on the optimal design space identification of possible constraint redundancies impact of constraint tolerances on the optimal solution and smoothness of the objective function contours.

1141,1301,Integrate-and-fire neurons driven by correlated stochastic input Neurons are sensitive to correlations among synaptic inputs. However analytical models that explicitly include correlations are hard to solve analytically so their influence on a neuron's response has been difficult to ascertain. To gain some intuition on this problem we studied the firing times of two simple integrate-and-fire model neurons driven by a correlated binary variable that represents the total input current. Analytic expressions were obtained for the average firing rate and coefficient of variation a measure of spike-train variability as functions of the mean variance and correlation time of the stochastic input. The results of computer simulations were in excellent agreement with these expressions. In these models an increase in correlation time in general produces an increase in both the average firing rate and the variability of the output spike trains. However the magnitude of the changes depends differentially on the relative values of the input mean and variance the increase in firing rate is higher when the variance is large relative to the mean whereas the increase in variability is higher when the variance is relatively small. In addition the firing rate always tends to a finite limit value as the correlation time increases toward infinity whereas the coefficient of variation typically diverges. These results suggest that temporal correlations may play a major role in determining the variability as well as the intensity of neuronal spike trains,"['integrate-and-fire neurons', 'correlated stochastic input', 'synaptic input correlations', 'firing times', 'correlated binary variable', 'coefficient of variation', 'spike-train variability', 'computer simulation', 'output spike trains', 'temporal correlations', 'bioelectric potentials', 'neural nets', 'neurophysiology']",236,13
1142,1302,Dynamics of the firing probability of noisy integrate-and-fire neurons Cortical neurons in vivo undergo a continuous bombardment due to synaptic activity which acts as a major source of noise. We investigate the effects of the noise filtering by synapses with various levels of realism on integrate-and-fire neuron dynamics. The noise input is modeled by white for instantaneous synapses or colored for synapses with a finite relaxation time noise. Analytical results for the modulation of firing probability in response to an oscillatory input current are obtained by expanding a Fokker-Planck equation for small parameters of the problem-when both the amplitude of the modulation is small compared to the background firing rate and the synaptic time constant is small compared to the membrane time constant. We report the detailed calculations showing that if a synaptic decay time constant is included in the synaptic current model the firing-rate modulation of the neuron due to an oscillatory input remains finite in the high-frequency limit with no phase lag. In addition we characterize the low-frequency behavior and the behavior of the high-frequency limit for intermediate decay times. We also characterize the effects of introducing a rise time to the synaptic currents and the presence of several synaptic receptors with different kinetics. In both cases we determine using numerical simulations an effective decay time constant that describes the neuronal response completely,"['firing probability', 'noisy integrate-and-fire neurons', 'cortical neurons', 'synaptic activity', 'noise filtering', 'white noise', 'colored noise', 'Fokker-Planck equation', 'synaptic time constant', 'membrane time constant', 'phase lag', 'synaptic receptors', 'numerical simulation', 'bioelectric potentials', 'Fokker-Planck equation', 'neural nets', 'neurophysiology', 'noise', 'probability']",225,19
1143,1303,Reply to Carreira-Perpinan and Goodhill mathematics in biology In a paper by Carreira-Perpinan and Goodhill see ibid. vol.14 no.7 p.1545-60 2002 the authors apply mathematical arguments to biology. Swindale et al. think it is inappropriate to apply the standards of proof required in mathematics to the acceptance or rejection of scientific hypotheses. To give some examples showing that data are well described by a linear model does not rule out an infinity of other possible models that might give better descriptions of the data. Proving in a mathematical sense that the linear model was correct would require ruling out all other possible models a hopeless task. Similarly to demonstrate that two DNA samples come from the same individual it is sufficient to show a match between only a few regions of the genome even though there remains a very large number of additional comparisons that could be done any one of which might potentially disprove the match. This is unacceptable in mathematics but in the real world it is a perfectly reasonable basis for belief,"['mathematical arguments', 'biology', 'scientific hypotheses', 'linear model', 'DNA', 'genome', 'hypothesis testing', 'cortical maps', 'neural nets', 'biology', 'neural nets']",175,11
1144,1304,Center-crossing recurrent neural networks for the evolution of rhythmic behavior A center-crossing recurrent neural network is one in which the null(hyper)surfaces of each neuron intersect at their exact centers of symmetry ensuring that each neuron's activation function is centered over the range of net inputs that it receives. We demonstrate that relative to a random initial population seeding the initial population of an evolutionary search with center-crossing networks significantly improves both the frequency and the speed with which high-fitness oscillatory circuits evolve on a simple walking task. The improvement is especially striking at low mutation variances. Our results suggest that seeding with center-crossing networks may often be beneficial since a wider range of dynamics is more likely to be easily accessible from a population of center-crossing networks than from a population of random networks,"['center-crossing recurrent neural networks', 'rhythmic behavior evolution', 'null surfaces', 'symmetry', 'activation function', 'evolutionary algorithm', 'random initial population', 'evolutionary search', 'high-fitness oscillatory circuits', 'learning', 'low mutation variance', 'random networks', 'evolutionary computation', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'recurrent neural nets', 'search problems']",134,16

1146,1306,Scalable hybrid computation with spikes We outline a hybrid analog-digital scheme for computing with three important features that enable it to scale to systems of large complexity First like digital computation which uses several one-bit precise logical units to collectively compute a precise answer to a computation the hybrid scheme uses several moderate-precision analog units to collectively compute a precise answer to a computation. Second frequent discrete signal restoration of the analog information prevents analog noise and offset from degrading the computation. Third a state machine enables complex computations to be created using a sequence of elementary computations. A natural choice for implementing this hybrid scheme is one based on spikes because spike-count codes are digital while spike-time codes are analog. We illustrate how spikes afford easy ways to implement all three components of scalable hybrid computation. First as an important example of distributed analog computation we show how spikes can create a distributed modular representation of an analog number by implementing digital carry interactions between spiking analog neurons. Second we show how signal restoration may be performed by recursive spike-count quantization of spike-time codes. Third we use spikes from an analog dynamical system to trigger state transitions in a digital dynamical system which reconfigures the analog dynamical system using a binary control vector such feedback interactions between analog and digital dynamical systems create a hybrid state machine HSM). The HSM extends and expands the concept of a digital finite-state-machine to the hybrid domain. We present experimental data from a two-neuron HSM on a chip that implements error-correcting analog-to-digital conversion with the concurrent use of spike-time and spike-count codes. We also present experimental data from silicon circuits that implement HSM-based pattern recognition using spike-time synchrony. We outline how HSMs may be used to perform learning vector quantization spike pattern recognition and generation and how they may be reconfigured,"['scalable hybrid computation', 'spikes', 'hybrid analog-digital scheme', 'moderate-precision analog units', 'frequent discrete signal restoration', 'analog noise', 'spike-count codes', 'finite-state-machine', 'distributed analog computation', 'spike-time codes', 'digital carry interactions', 'binary control vector', 'feedback interactions', 'two neuron hybrid state machine', 'error-correcting analog-to-digital conversion', 'silicon circuits', 'pattern recognition', 'learning', 'vector quantization', 'analogue-digital conversion', 'digital arithmetic', 'error correction', 'finite state machines', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'neural chips', 'pattern recognition', 'signal restoration', 'vector quantisation']",308,28

1151,1311,Blended implementation of block implicit methods for ODEs In this paper we further develop a new approach for naturally defining the nonlinear splittings needed for the implementation of block implicit methods for ODEs which has been considered by Brugnano J. Comput. Appl. Math. 116 2000 41 and by Brugnano and Trigiante in Recent Trends in Numerical Analysis Nova Science New York 2000 pp. 81-105]. The basic idea is that of defining the numerical method as the combination blending of two suitable component methods. By carefully choosing such methods it is shown that very efficient implementations can be obtained. Moreover some of them characterized by a diagonal splitting are well suited for parallel computers. Numerical tests comparing the performances of the proposed implementation with existing ones are also presented in order to make evident the potential of the approach,"['nonlinear splittings', 'block implicit methods', 'blended implementation', 'ODEs', 'numerical method', 'diagonal splitting', 'parallel computers', 'numerical tests', 'differential equations']",138,9

Finite differences are used for the discretization in space. The matrices specifying the resulting semidiscrete problem are proved to satisfy a sectorial resolvent condition uniformly with respect to the discretization parameter. Using this resolvent condition unconditional stability is proved for the fully discrete numerical process generated by applying A theta stable one-step methods to the semidiscrete problem. This stability result is established in the maximum norm it improves some previous results in the literature in that it is not subject to various unnatural restrictions which were imposed on the boundary conditions and on the one-step methods,"['numerical solution', 'heat equation', 'nonlocal boundary conditions', 'stability', 'integral boundary conditions', 'finite differences', 'space discretization', 'matrices', 'semidiscrete problem', 'sectorial resolvent condition', 'fully discrete numerical process', 'one-step methods', 'maximum norm', 'finite difference methods', 'heat', 'matrix algebra', 'numerical stability', 'physics computing']",126,18

To make them practically useful they have to be implemented by varying the step-size according to some error-control algorithm. It is well known how to extend Adams and BDF formulas to a variable step-size formulation. In this paper we present a collocation approach to construct variable step-size formulas.

1154,1314,Multi-timescale Internet traffic engineering The Internet is a collection of packet-based hop-by-hop routed networks. Internet traffic engineering is the process of allocating resources to meet the performance requirements of users and operators for their traffic. Current mechanisms for doing so exemplified by TCP's congestion control or the variety of packet marking disciplines concentrate on allocating resources on a per-packet basis or at data timescales. This article motivates the need for traffic engineering in the Internet at other timescales namely control and management timescales and presents three mechanisms for this. It also presents a scenario to show how these mechanisms increase the flexibility of operators service offerings and potentially also ease problems of Internet management,"['multi-timescale Internet traffic engineering', 'packet-based hop-by-hop routed networks', 'TCP congestion control', 'packet marking disciplines', 'resource allocation', 'control timescale', 'operator services', 'Internet management', 'admission control', 'ECN proxy', 'BGP routing protocol', 'computer network management', 'Internet', 'internetworking', 'packet switching', 'telecommunication congestion control', 'telecommunication network routing', 'telecommunication traffic', 'transport protocols']",114,19

We describe an approach to intradomain traffic engineering that works within the existing deployed base of interior gateway protocols such as Open Shortest Path First and Intermediate System-Intermediate System. We explain how to adapt the configuration of link weights based on a networkwide view of the traffic and topology within a domain. In addition we summarize the results of several studies of techniques for optimizing OSPF/IS-IS weights to the prevailing traffic.

1156,1316,Understanding Internet traffic streams dragonflies and tortoises We present the concept of network traffic streams and the ways they aggregate into flows through Internet links. We describe a method of measuring the size and lifetime of Internet streams and use this method to characterize traffic distributions at two different sites. We find that although most streams about 45 percent of them are dragonflies lasting less than 2 seconds a significant number of streams have lifetimes of hours to days and can carry a high proportion 50-60 percent of the total bytes on a given link. We define tortoises as streams that last longer than 15 minutes. We point out that streams can be classified not only by lifetime dragonflies and tortoises but also by size mice and elephants and note that stream size and lifetime are independent dimensions. We submit that ISPs need to be aware of the distribution of Internet stream sizes and the impact of the difference in behavior between short and long streams. In particular any forwarding cache mechanisms in Internet routers must be able to cope with a high volume of short streams. In addition ISPs should realize that long-running streams can contribute a significant fraction of their packet and byte volumes-something they may not have allowed for when using traditional flat rate user bandwidth consumption approaches to provisioning and engineering,"['Internet traffic streams', 'dragonflies', 'tortoises', 'network traffic streams', 'Internet stream size measurement', 'Internet stream lifetime measurement', 'traffic distributions', 'mice', 'elephants', 'ISP', 'forwarding cache mechanisms', 'Internet routers', 'long-running streams', 'packet volume', 'byte volume', 'traffic provisioning', 'traffic engineering', 'Internet', 'packet switching', 'performance evaluation', 'telecommunication network routing', 'telecommunication traffic']",225,22
1157,1317,Dynamic spectrum management for next-generation DSL systems The performance of DSL systems is severely constrained by crosstalk due to the electromagnetic coupling among the multiple twisted pairs making up a phone cable. In order to reduce performance loss arising from crosstalk DSL systems are currently designed under the assumption of worst-case crosstalk scenarios leading to overly conservative DSL deployments. This article presents a new paradigm for DSL system design which takes into account the multi-user aspects of the DSL transmission environment. Dynamic spectrum management DSM departs from the current design philosophy by enabling transceivers to autonomously and dynamically optimize their communication settings with respect to both the channel and the transmissions of neighboring systems. Along with this distributed optimization when an additional degree of coordination becomes available for future DSL deployment DSM will allow even greater improvement in DSL performance. Implementations are readily applicable without causing any performance degradation to the existing DSLs under static spectrum management. After providing an overview of the DSM concept this article reviews two practical DSM methods iterative water-filling an autonomous distributed power control method enabling great improvement in performance which can be implemented through software options in some existing ADSL and VDSL systems and vectored-DMT a coordinated transmission/reception technique achieving crosstalk-free communication for DSL systems which brings within reach the dream of providing universal Internet access at speeds close to 100 Mb/s to 500 m on 1-2 lines and beyond 1 km on 2-4 lines.

1159,1319,Routing security in wireless ad hoc networks A mobile ad hoc network consists of a collection of wireless mobile nodes that are capable of communicating with each other without the use of a network infrastructure or any centralized administration. MANET is an emerging research area with practical applications. However wireless MANET is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics such as open medium dynamic topology distributed cooperation and constrained capability. Routing plays an important role in the security of the entire network. In general routing security in wireless MANETs appears to be a problem that is not trivial to solve. In this article we study the routing security issues of MANETs and analyze in detail one type of attack-the black hole problem-that can easily be employed against the MANETs. We also propose a solution for the black hole problem for ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol,"['routing security', 'wireless ad hoc networks', 'mobile ad hoc network', 'wireless mobile nodes', 'wireless MANET', 'open medium', 'dynamic topology', 'distributed cooperation', 'on-demand distance vector routing protocol', 'satellite transmission', 'home wireless personal area networks', 'land mobile radio', 'radio networks', 'security of data', 'telecommunication network routing', 'telecommunication security', 'transport protocols']",147,17
1160,1320,Securing the Internet routing infrastructure The unprecedented growth of the Internet over the last years and the expectation of an even faster increase in the numbers of users and networked systems resulted in the Internet assuming its position as a mass communication medium. At the same time the emergence of an increasingly large number of application areas and the evolution of the networking technology suggest that in the near future the Internet may become the single integrated communication infrastructure. However as the dependence on the networking infrastructure grows its security becomes a major concern in light of the increased attempt to compromise the infrastructure. In particular the routing operation is a highly visible target that must be shielded against a wide range of attacks. The injection of false routing information can easily degrade network performance or even cause denial of service for a large number of hosts and networks over a long period of time. Different approaches have been proposed to secure the routing protocols with a variety of countermeasures which nonetheless have not eradicated the vulnerability of the routing infrastructure. In this article we survey the up-to-date secure routing schemes. that appeared over the last few years.

In a typical DDoS attack a large number of compromised hosts are amassed to send useless packets to jam a victim or its Internet connection or both. In the last two years it was discovered that DDoS attack methods and tools are becoming more sophisticated effective and also more difficult to trace to the real attackers. On the defense side current technologies are still unable to withstand large-scale attacks. The main purpose of this article is therefore twofold. The first one is to describe various DDoS attack methods and to present a systematic review and evaluation of the existing defense mechanisms.

We present a novel method that works by first matching both sides of a document such that the interfering strokes are mapped with the corresponding strokes originating from the reverse side. This facilitates the identification of the foreground and interfering strokes. A wavelet reconstruction process then iteratively enhances the foreground strokes and smears the interfering strokes so as to strengthen the discriminating capability of an improved Canny edge detector against the interfering strokes.

1182,1345,Infrared-image classification using hidden Markov trees An image of a three-dimensional target is generally characterized by the visible target subcomponents with these dictated by the target-sensor orientation target pose). An image often changes quickly with variable pose. We define a class as a set of contiguous target-sensor orientations over which the associated target image is relatively stationary with aspect. Each target is in general characterized by multiple classes. A distinct set of Wiener filters are employed for each class of images to identify the presence of target subcomponents. A Karhunen-Loeve representation is used to minimize the number of filters templates associated with a given subcomponent. The statistical relationships between the different target subcomponents are modeled via a hidden Markov tree HMT). The HMT classifier is discussed and example results are presented for forward-looking-infrared FLIR imagery of several vehicles,"['IR image classification', 'infrared-image classification', 'hidden Markov trees', '3D target image', 'target-sensor orientation', 'target pose', 'contiguous target-sensor orientations', 'Wiener filters', 'Karhunen-Loeve representation', 'minimization', 'HMT', 'forward-looking-infrared imagery', 'FLIR imagery', 'vehicles', 'image classification', 'infrared imaging', 'Karhunen-Loeve transforms', 'Markov processes', 'minimisation', 'trees (mathematics)', 'Wiener filters']",138,21

1184,1347,A maximum-likelihood surface estimator for dense range data Describes how to estimate 3D surface models from dense sets of noisy range data taken from different points of view i.e. multiple range maps. The proposed method uses a sensor model to develop an expression for the likelihood of a 3D surface conditional on a set of noisy range measurements. Optimizing this likelihood with respect to the model parameters provides an unbiased and efficient estimator. The proposed numerical algorithms make this estimation computationally practical for a wide variety of circumstances. The results from this method compare favorably with state-of-the-art approaches that rely on the closest-point or perpendicular distance metric a convenient heuristic that produces biased solutions and fails completely when surfaces are not sufficiently smooth as in the case of complex scenes or noisy range measurements. Empirical results on both simulated and real ladar data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for several different types of problems. Furthermore the proposed method offers a general framework that can accommodate extensions to include surface priors more sophisticated noise models and other sensing modalities such as sonar or synthetic aperture radar,"['maximum-likelihood surface estimator', 'dense range data', '3D surface models', 'noisy range data', 'sensor model', 'unbiased estimator', 'heuristic', 'biased solutions', 'complex scenes', 'noisy range measurements', 'simulated ladar data', 'real ladar data', 'sonar', 'synthetic aperture radar', 'surface reconstruction', 'surface fitting', 'optimal estimation', 'parameter estimation', 'Bayesian estimation', 'registration', 'calibration', 'calibration', 'computer vision', 'distance measurement', 'image registration', 'maximum likelihood estimation', 'optical radar', 'surface fitting']",187,28
1185,1348,Reconstructing surfaces by volumetric regularization using radial basis functions We present a new method of surface reconstruction that generates smooth and seamless models from sparse noisy nonuniform and low resolution range data. Data acquisition techniques from computer vision such as stereo range images and space carving produce 3D point sets that are imprecise and nonuniform when compared to laser or optical range scanners. Traditional reconstruction algorithms designed for dense and precise data do not produce smooth reconstructions when applied to vision-based data sets. Our method constructs a 3D implicit surface formulated as a sum of weighted radial basis functions. We achieve three primary advantages over existing algorithms 1 the implicit functions we construct estimate the surface well in regions where there is little data 2 the reconstructed surface is insensitive to noise in data acquisition because we can allow the surface to approximate rather than exactly interpolate the data and 3 the reconstructed surface is locally detailed yet globally smooth because we use radial basis functions that achieve multiple orders of smoothness,"['surfaces reconstruction', 'volumetric regularization', 'radial basis functions', 'sparse range data', 'noisy data', 'nonuniform data', 'low resolution range data', 'data acquisition techniques', 'computer vision', 'stereo range images', 'space carving', '3D point sets', 'vision-based data sets', '3D implicit surface', 'weighted radial basis functions', 'computer vision', 'image reconstruction', 'image texture', 'interpolation', 'surface fitting']",172,20
1186,1349,Efficient simplicial reconstructions of manifolds from their samples An algorithm for manifold learning is presented. Given only samples of a finite-dimensional differentiable manifold and no a priori knowledge of the manifold's geometry or topology except for its dimension the goal is to find a description of the manifold. The learned manifold must approximate the true manifold well both geometrically and topologically when the sampling density is sufficiently high. The proposed algorithm constructs a simplicial complex based on approximations to the tangent bundle of the manifold. An important property of the algorithm is that its complexity depends on the dimension of the manifold rather than that of the embedding space. Successful examples are presented in the cases of learning curves in the plane curves in space and surfaces in space in addition a case when the algorithm fails is analyzed,"['simplicial reconstructions', 'manifold learning', 'finite-dimensional differentiable manifold', 'learned manifold', 'true manifold', 'simplicial complex', 'sampling density', 'computational complexity', 'computational geometry', 'computer vision', 'Hilbert spaces', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'topology']",139,13
1187,1350,Generalized mosaicing wide field of view multispectral imaging We present an approach to significantly enhance the spectral resolution of imaging systems by generalizing image mosaicing. A filter transmitting spatially varying spectral bands is rigidly attached to a camera. As the system moves it senses each scene point multiple times each time in a different spectral band. This is an additional dimension of the generalized mosaic paradigm which has demonstrated yielding high radiometric dynamic range images in a wide field of view using a spatially varying density filter. The resulting mosaic represents the spectrum at each scene point. The image acquisition is as easy as in traditional image mosaics. We derive an efficient scene sampling rate and use a registration method that accommodates the spatially varying properties of the filter. Using the data acquired by this method we demonstrate scene rendering under different simulated illumination spectra. We are also able to infer information about the scene illumination. The approach was tested using a standard 8-bit black/white video camera and a fixed spatially varying spectral interference filter,"['generalized mosaicing', 'wide field of view multispectral imaging', 'spatially varying spectral bands', 'spatially varying density filter', 'image acquisition', 'scene sampling rate', 'registration method', 'scene rendering', 'simulated illumination spectra', 'scene illumination', 'hyperspectral imaging', 'color balance', 'image fusion', 'physics-based vision', 'image-based rendering', 'computer vision', 'image enhancement', 'image registration', 'image sampling', 'image segmentation', 'lighting', 'rendering (computer graphics)']",175,22
1188,1351,Analytic PCA construction for theoretical analysis of lighting variability in images of a Lambertian object We analyze theoretically the subspace best approximating images of a convex Lambertian object taken from the same viewpoint but under different distant illumination conditions. We analytically construct the principal component analysis for images of a convex Lambertian object explicitly taking attached shadows into account and find the principal eigenmodes and eigenvalues with respect to lighting variability. Our analysis makes use of an analytic formula for the irradiance in terms of spherical-harmonic coefficients of the illumination and shows under appropriate assumptions that the principal components or eigenvectors are identical to the spherical harmonic basis functions evaluated at the surface normal vectors. Our main contribution is in extending these results to the single-viewpoint case showing how the principal eigenmodes and eigenvalues are affected when only a limited subset the upper hemisphere of normals is available and the spherical harmonics are no longer orthonormal over the restricted domain. Our results are very close both qualitatively and quantitatively to previous empirical observations and represent the first essentially complete theoretical explanation of these observations,"['analytic principal component analysis', 'spherical harmonics', 'lighting variability', 'five-dimensional subspace', 'convex Lambertian object', 'surface normal vectors', 'principal eigenmodes', 'principal eigenvalues', 'radiance', 'irradiance', 'computer vision', 'eigenvalues and eigenfunctions', 'lighting', 'object recognition', 'principal component analysis']",184,15
1189,1352,Elastically adaptive deformable models We present a technique for the automatic adaptation of a deformable model's elastic parameters within a Kalman filter framework for shape estimation applications. The novelty of the technique is that the model's elastic parameters are not constant but spatio-temporally varying. The variation of the elastic parameters depends on the distance of the model from the data and the rate of change of this distance. Each pass of the algorithm uses physics-based modeling techniques to iteratively adjust both the geometric and the elastic degrees of freedom of the model in response to forces that are computed from the discrepancy between the model and the data. By augmenting the state equations of an extended Kalman filter to incorporate these additional variables we are able to significantly improve the quality of the shape estimation. Therefore the model's elastic parameters are always initialized to the same value and they are subsequently modified depending on the data and the noise distribution. We present results demonstrating the effectiveness of our method for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional data,"['elastically adaptive deformable models', 'automatic adaptation', 'elastic parameters', 'Kalman filter framework', 'shape estimation', 'physics-based modeling techniques', 'geometric degrees of freedom', 'elastic degrees of freedom', 'state equations', 'extended Kalman filter', 'computer vision', 'filtering theory', 'geometry', 'Kalman filters', 'nonlinear filters', 'parameter estimation']",175,16
1190,1353,Generalized spatio-chromatic diffusion A framework for diffusion of color images is presented. The method is based on the theory of thermodynamics of irreversible transformations which provides a suitable basis for designing correlations between the different color channels.

1191,1354,Design and analysis of optimal material distribution policies in flexible manufacturing systems using a single AGV Modern automated manufacturing processes employ automated guided vehicles AGVs for material handling which serve several machine centres MC in a factory. Optimal scheduling of AGVs can significantly help to increase the efficiency of the manufacturing process by minimizing the idle time of MCs waiting for the raw materials. We analyse the requirements for an optimal schedule and then provide a mathematical framework for an efficient schedule of material delivery by an AGV. A mathematical model is developed and then a strategy for optimal material distribution of the available raw material to the MCs is derived. With this model the optimal number of MCs to be utilized is also determined. Finally the material delivery schedule employing multiple journeys to the MCs by the AGV is carried out. Through rigorous analysis and simulation experiments we show that such a delivery strategy will optimize the overall performance,"['optimal material distribution policies', 'flexible manufacturing systems', 'AGV', 'automated guided vehicle', 'material handling', 'machine centres', 'waiting time', 'manufacturing lead time', 'optimal scheduling', 'idle time minimization', 'material delivery', 'automatic guided vehicles', 'flexible manufacturing systems', 'flow graphs', 'materials handling', 'optimisation', 'production control']",160,17

1193,1356,Five-axis NC milling of ruled surfaces optimal geometry of a conical tool The side milling of ruled surfaces using a conical milling cutter was studied. This is a field that has largely been ignored by research scientists but it is much used in industry especially to machine turbine blades. We first suggest an improved positioning with respect to the directrices of the ruled surface. As compared with the methods already developed for the cylindrical cutter this positioning enables the error between the cutter and the work-piece to be reduced. An algorithm is then introduced to calculate error so one can determine the cutter dimensions cone radius and angle in order to respect the tolerance interval imposed by the design office. This study provides an opportunity to determine cutters with greater dimensions thus alleviating bending problems during milling,"['five-axis NC milling', 'ruled surfaces', 'optimal geometry', 'conical', 'side milling', 'conical milling cutter', 'positioning', 'cutter dimensions', 'tolerance interval', 'CAD/CAM', 'machine tools', 'machining', 'numerical control', 'position control']",137,14
1194,1357,Work sequencing in a manufacturing cell with limited labour constraints This study focuses on the analysis of group scheduling heuristics in a dual-constrained automated manufacturing cell where labour utilization is limited to setups tear-downs and loads/unloads. This scenario is realistic in today's automated manufacturing cells. The results indicate that policies for allocating labour to tasks have very little impact in such an environment. Furthermore the performance of efficiency oriented exhaustive group scheduling heuristics deteriorated while the performance of the more complex non-exhaustive heuristics improved. Thus it is recommended that production managers use the simplest labour scheduling policy and instead focus their efforts to activities such as job scheduling and production planning in such environments,"['work sequencing', 'manufacturing cell', 'limited labour constraints', 'group scheduling heuristics', 'dual-constrained automated manufacturing cell', 'automated manufacturing cells', 'labour allocation policies', 'efficiency oriented exhaustive group scheduling heuristics', 'nonexhaustive heuristics', 'production planning', 'job scheduling', 'assembly planning', 'heuristic programming', 'production control', 'production engineering computing', 'resource allocation']",114,16
1195,1358,Analysis of the surface roughness and dimensional accuracy capability of fused deposition modelling processes Building up materials in layers poses significant challenges from the viewpoint of material science heat transfer and applied mechanics. However numerous aspects of the use of these technologies have yet to be studied. One of these aspects is the characterization of the surface roughness and dimensional precision obtainable in layered manufacturing processes. In this paper a study of roughness parameters obtained through the use of these manufacturing processes was made. Prototype parts were manufactured using FDM techniques and an experimental analysis of the resulting roughness average R/sub a and rms roughness R/sub q obtained through the use of these manufacturing processes was carried out.

1198,1361,Adaptive scheduling of batch servers in flow shops Batch servicing is a common way of benefiting from economies of scale in manufacturing operations. Good examples of production systems that allow for batch processing are ovens found in the aircraft industry and in semiconductor manufacturing. In this paper we study the issue of dynamic scheduling of such systems within the context of multi-stage flow shops. So far a great deal of research has concentrated on the development of control strategies which only address the batch stage. This paper proposes an integral scheduling approach that also includes succeeding stages. In this way we aim for shop optimization instead of optimizing performance for a single stage. Our so-called look-ahead strategy adapts its scheduling decision to shop status which includes information on a limited number of near-future arrivals. In particular we study a two-stage flow shop in which the batch stage is succeeded by a serial stage. The serial stage may be realized by a single machine or by parallel machines. Through an extensive simulation study it is demonstrated how shop performance can be improved by the proposed strategy relative to existing strategies,"['adaptive scheduling', 'batch servers', 'flow shops', 'batch servicing', 'manufacturing operations', 'production systems', 'ovens', 'aircraft industry', 'semiconductor manufacturing', 'dynamic scheduling', 'multi-stage flow shops', 'control strategies', 'integral scheduling approach', 'shop optimization', 'look-ahead strategy', 'near-future arrivals', 'two-stage flow shop', 'single machine', 'parallel machines', 'simulation study', 'batch processing (industrial)', 'optimisation', 'process heating', 'production control']",189,24
1199,1362,Process planning for reliable high-speed machining of moulds A method of generating NC programs for the high-speed milling of moulds is investigated. Forging dies and injection moulds whether plastic or aluminium have a complex surface geometry. In addition they are made of steels of hardness as much as 30 or even 50 HRC. Since 1995 high-speed machining has been much adopted by the die-making industry which with this technology can reduce its use of Sinking Electrodischarge Machining SEDM). EDM in general calls for longer machining times. The use of high-speed machining makes it necessary to redefine the preliminary stages of the process. In addition it affects the methodology employed in the generation of NC programs which requires the use of high-level CAM software. The aim is to generate error-free programs that make use of optimum cutting strategies in the interest of productivity and surface quality. The final result is a more reliable manufacturing process. There are two risks in the use of high-speed milling on hardened steels. One of these is tool breakage which may be very costly and may furthermore entail marks on the workpiece. The other is collisions between the tool and the workpiece or fixtures the result of which may be damage to the ceramic bearings in the spindles. in order to minimize these risks it is necessary that new control and optimization steps be included in the CAM methodology. There are three things that the firm adopting high-speed methods should do. It should redefine its process engineering it should systematize access by its CAM programmers to high-speed knowhow and it should take up the use of process simulation tools. In the latter case it will be very advantageous to use tools for the estimation of cutting forces. The new work methods proposed in this article have made it possible to introduce high speed milling HSM into the die industry. Examples are given of how the technique has been applied with CAM programming re-engineered as here proposed with an explanation of the novel features and the results,"['moulds', 'reliable high-speed machining', 'process planning', 'NC programs', 'high-speed milling', 'forging dies', 'injection moulds', 'complex surface geometry', 'error-free programs', 'optimum cutting strategies', 'productivity', 'surface quality', 'hardened steels', 'tool breakage', 'tool workpiece collisions', 'ceramic bearings', 'CAM methodology', 'process engineering redefinition', 'process simulation tools', 'CAM programming re-engineering', 'cutting strategies', 'CAD/CAM', 'computer aided production planning', 'computerised numerical control', 'cutting', 'forging', 'machining', 'moulding', 'systems re-engineering']",340,29
1200,1363,Heuristics for single-pass welding task sequencing Welding task sequencing is a prerequisite in the offline programming of robot arc welding. Single-pass welding task sequencing can be modelled as a modified travelling salesman problem. Owing to the difficulty of the resulting arc-routing problems effective local search heuristics are developed. Computational speed becomes important because robot arc welding is often part of an automated process-planning procedure. Generating a reasonable solution in an acceptable time is necessary for effective automated process planning. Several different heuristics are proposed for solving the welding task-sequencing problem considering both productivity and the potential for welding distortion. Constructive heuristics based on the nearest neighbour concept and tabu search heuristics are developed and enhanced using improvement procedures. The effectiveness of the heuristics developed is tested and verified on actual welded structure problems and random problems,"['single-pass welding task sequencing', 'constructive heuristics', 'offline programming', 'robot arc welding', 'modified travelling salesman problem', 'local search heuristics', 'computational speed', 'automated process-planning procedure', 'productivity', 'welding distortion', 'nearest neighbour concept', 'tabu search heuristics', 'random problems', 'welded structure problems', 'arc welding', 'assembly planning', 'computer aided production planning', 'heuristic programming', 'industrial robots', 'robot programming', 'search problems', 'travelling salesman problems']",136,22
1201,1364,An adaptive sphere-fitting method for sequential tolerance control The machining of complex parts typically involves a logical and chronological sequence of n operations on m machine tools. Because manufacturing datums cannot always match design constraints some of the design specifications imposed on the part are usually satisfied by distinct subsets of the n operations prescribed in the process plan. Conventional tolerance control specifies a fixed set point for each operation and a permissible variation about this set point to insure compliance with the specifications whereas sequential tolerance control STC uses real-time measurement information at the completion of one stage to reposition the set point for subsequent operations. However it has been shown that earlier sphere-fitting methods for STC can lead to inferior solutions when the process distributions are skewed. This paper introduces an extension of STC that uses an adaptive sphere-fitting method that significantly improves the yield in the presence of skewed distributions as well as significantly reducing the computational effort required by earlier probabilistic search methods,"['machine tools', 'sequential tolerance control', 'adaptive sphere-fitting method', 'design constraints', 'compliance', 'real-time measurement information', 'yield improvement', 'skewed distributions', 'computational effort', 'constraint theory', 'machine tools', 'optimisation', 'production control', 'tolerance analysis']",167,14
1202,1365,Deadlock-free scheduling in flexible manufacturing systems using Petri nets This paper addresses the deadlock-free scheduling problem in Flexible Manufacturing Systems. An efficient deadlock-free scheduling algorithm was developed using timed Petri nets for a class of FMSs called Systems of Sequential Systems with Shared Resources S/sup 4 R). The algorithm generates a partial reachability graph to find the optimal or near-optimal deadlock-free schedule in terms of the firing sequence of the transitions of the Petri net model. The objective is to minimize the mean flow time MFT). An efficient truncation technique based on the siphon concept has been developed and used to generate the minimum necessary portion of the reachability graph to be searched. It has been shown experimentally that the developed siphon truncation technique enhances the ability to develop deadlock-free schedules of systems with a high number of deadlocks which cannot be achieved using standard Petri net scheduling approaches. It may be necessary in some cases to relax the optimality condition for large FMSs in order to make the search effort reasonable. Hence a User Control Factor UCF was defined and used in the scheduling algorithm. The objective of using the UCF is to achieve an acceptable trade-off between the solution quality and the search effort. Its effect on the MFT and the CPU time has been investigated. Randomly generated examples are used for illustration and comparison. Although the effect of UCF did not affect the mean flow time it was shown that increasing it reduces the search effort CPU time significantly,"['flexible manufacturing systems', 'deadlock-free scheduling', 'Petri nets', 'systems of sequential systems with shared resources', 'partial reachability graph', 'optimal deadlock-free schedule', 'near-optimal deadlock-free schedule', 'Petri net model transitions firing sequence', 'mean flow time minimization', 'siphon truncation technique', 'optimality condition relaxation', 'user control factor', 'CPU time', 'randomly generated examples', 'flexible manufacturing systems', 'minimisation', 'Petri nets', 'production control', 'reachability analysis', 'resource allocation']",252,20
1203,1366,A fuzzy-soft learning vector quantization for control chart pattern recognition This paper presents a supervised competitive learning network approach called a fuzzy-soft learning vector quantization for control chart pattern recognition. Unnatural patterns in control charts mean that there are some unnatural causes for variations in statistical process control SPC). Hence control chart pattern recognition becomes more important in SPC. In order to detect effectively the patterns for the six main types of control charts Pham and Oztemel 1994 described a class of pattern recognizers for control charts based on the learning vector quantization LVQ such as LVQ LVQ2 and LVQ-X etc. In this paper we propose a new supervised LVQ for control charts based on a fuzzy-soft competitive learning network.

1205,1368,Exploratory study of the adoption of manufacturing technology innovations in the USA and the UK Manufacturing technologies appropriately implemented provide competitive advantage to manufacturers. The use of manufacturing technologies across countries is difficult to compare.

The present study compares the use of 17 different technologies in similar industries in the USA n=1025 and UK n=166 using a common questionnaire. Largely there are remarkable similarities between the two countries. This may partly correlate with the heavy traffic in foreign direct investment between the two nations. Notable differences are 1 across-the-board US manufacturers are ahead of the UK firms in computerized integration with units inside and outside manufacturing organizations 2 US manufacturers show higher labour productivity which is consistent with macro-economic data and 3 more UK manufacturers report the use of soft technologies such as just-in-time total quality manufacturing and manufacturing cells.

1210,1373,Agent-based product-support logistics system using XML and RDF The capability of the timely provision of maintenance services and service parts is critical to the competitiveness of industrial systems. To enhance the timely operations in a product-support logistics chain business partners equipment manufacturers parts distributors customers may have to collaborate for the efficient exchange of relevant information. We propose the architecture of an agent-based product-support logistics system. Emphasis is placed on the problems of sharing and exchanging information through agent communication. We adopt the Resource Description Framework RDF schema for information modelling in product-support logistics domain. The eXtensible Markup Language XML serialization generates messages for agent communication. The use of XML and RDF enables software agents to understand the contents of messages correctly and consistently. We demonstrate the feasibility of our agent architecture using a scenario in logistical support processes. We believe that the approach can provide a promising way to the automation of business processes in product-support logistics through seamless communication among the partners,"['agent-based product-support logistics system', 'XML', 'RDF', 'service parts', 'industrial systems', 'maintenance services', 'Resource Description Framework schema', 'information modelling', 'eXtensible Markup Language', 'software agents', 'software agents', 'software maintenance']",164,12

1212,1375,Evaluation of the usability of digital maintenance manuals developed without either user input or a task analysis The primary objective was to investigate the value that can be added to a low-cost digital maintenance manual by the addition of a navigational aid. Two versions of a digital maintenance manual were developed the difference between them being the number of design heuristics observed when designing navigational aids. Neither version was based on an analysis of the tasks carried out by users nor were users involved in the design process. Instead the manuals were developed directly from the digital information used to produce the existing paper manual. Usability trials were carried out to test both versions according to the time taken and errors committed by users during typical information retrieval tasks. Users were questioned to determine their ease of use EOU perceptions for each manual. The main outcomes were that the navigation aid used in the second version reduced the time taken to use the manual but increased the number of errors made by users. The navigational aid also seemed to reduce the perceived EOU compared with the first version. In both cases the perceived EOU was lower than for a previous digital manual that had been developed using a task analysis and user input. The paper concludes by recommending the development of a generic task model of user interaction with digital maintenance manuals,"['digital maintenance manuals usability', 'navigational aid', 'usability trials', 'information retrieval', 'generic task model', 'user interaction', 'task analysis', 'information retrieval', 'task analysis', 'user manuals']",232,10
1213,1376,Enhanced product support through intelligent product manuals The scope of this paper is the provision of intelligent product support within the distributed Intranet/Internet environment. From the point of view of user requirements the limitations of conventional product manuals and methods of authoring them are first outlined. It is argued that enhanced product support requires new technology solutions both for product manuals and for their authoring and presentation. The concept and the architecture of intelligent product manuals are then discussed. A prototype system called ProARTWeb is presented to demonstrate advanced features of intelligent product manuals. Next the problem of producing such manuals in a cost-effective way is addressed and a concurrent engineering approach to their authoring is proposed. An integrated environment for collaborative authoring called ProAuthor is described to illustrate the approach suggested and to show how consistent up-to-date and user-oriented-product manuals can be designed. The solutions presented here enable product knowledge to be captured and delivered to users and developers of product manuals when where and in the form they need it,"['intelligent product support', 'intelligent product manuals', 'product manuals', 'ProARTWeb', 'concurrent engineering', 'product knowledge', 'technical information', 'concurrent engineering', 'electronic publishing']",172,9
1214,1377,Open hypermedia for product support As industrial systems become increasingly more complex the maintenance and operating information increases both in volume and complexity. With the current pressures on manufacturing the management of information resources has become a critical issue. In particular ensuring that personnel can access current information quickly and effectively when undertaking a specific task. This paper discusses some of the issues involved in and the benefits of using open hypermedia to manage and deliver a diverse range of information. While the paper concentrates on the problems specifically associated with manufacturing organizations the problems are generic across other business sectors such as healthcare defence and finance. The open hypermedia approach to information management and delivery allows a multimedia resource base to be used for a range of applications and it permits a user to have controlled access to the required information in an easily accessible and structured manner. Recent advancement in hypermedia also permits just-in-time support in the most appropriate format for all users. Our approach is illustrated by the discussion of a case study in which an open hypermedia system delivers maintenance and process information to factory-floor users to support the maintenance and operation of a very large manufacturing cell,"['open hypermedia', 'maintenance', 'operating information', 'information resources', 'just-in-time support', 'product support', 'hypermedia', 'information resources', 'multimedia systems', 'production control']",202,10

1217,1380,A feature-preserving volumetric technique to merge surface triangulations Several extensions and improvements to surface merging procedures based on the extraction of isosurfaces from a distance map defined on an adaptive background grid are presented. The main objective is to extend the application of these algorithms to surfaces with sharp edges and comers. In order to deal with objects of different length scales the initial background grids are created using a Delaunay triangulation method and local voxelizations. A point enrichment technique that introduces points into the background grid along detected surface features such as ridges is used to ensure that these features are preserved in the final merged surface. The surface merging methodology is extended to include other Boolean operations between surface triangulations. The iso-surface extraction algorithms are modified to obtain the correct iso-surface for multi-component objects. The procedures are demonstrated with various examples ranging from simple geometrical entities to complex engineering applications. The present algorithms allow realistic modelling of a large number of complex engineering geometries using overlapping components defined discretely i.e. via surface triangulations. This capability is very useful for grid generation starting from data originated in measurements or images,"['feature-preserving volumetric technique', 'merge surface triangulations', 'surface merging procedures', 'iso-surfaces extraction', 'multi-component objects', 'simple geometrical entities', 'complex engineering applications', 'overlapping components', 'images', 'mesh generation', 'unstructured grids', 'discrete data', 'surface intersection', 'geometric modelling', 'adaptive background grid', 'sharp edges', 'sharp comers', 'Delaunay triangulation method', 'local voxelizations', 'point enrichment technique background grid', 'ridges', 'Boolean operations', 'surface triangulations', 'arterial surfaces', 'haemoglobin molecule', 'mesh generation', 'physiological models']",191,27
1218,1381,An augmented spatial digital tree algorithm for contact detection in computational mechanics Based on the understanding of existing spatial digital tree-based contact detection approaches and the alternating digital tree ADT algorithm in particular a more efficient algorithm termed the augmented spatial digital tree ASDT algorithm is proposed in the present work. The ASDT algorithm adopts a different point representation scheme that uses only the lower comer vertex to represent a hyper-)rectangle with the upper comer vertex serving as the augmented information. Consequently the ASDT algorithm can keep the working space the same as the original n-dimensional space and in general a much better balanced tree can be expected. This together with the introduction of an additional bounding subregion for the rectangles associated with each tree node makes it possible to significantly reduce the number of node visits in the region search although each node visit may be slightly more expensive. Three examples arising in computational mechanics are presented to provide an assessment of the performance of the ASDT. The numerical results indicate that the ASDT is at least over 3.9 times faster than the ADT,"['augmented spatial digital tree algorithm', 'contact detection', 'computational mechanics', 'alternating digital tree algorithm', 'upper comer vertex', 'augmented data structure', 'spatial binary tree-based contact detection approaches', 'digital simulation', 'finite element analysis', 'mechanical contact', 'physics computing']",185,11
1219,1382,Loop restructuring for data I/O minimization on limited on-chip memory embedded processors In this paper we propose a framework for analyzing the flow of values and their reuse in loop nests to minimize data traffic under the constraints of limited on-chip memory capacity and dependences. Our analysis first undertakes fusion of possible loop nests intra-procedurally and then performs loop distribution. The analysis discovers the closeness factor of two statements which is a quantitative measure of data traffic saved per unit memory occupied if the statements were under the same loop nest over the case where they are under different loop nests. We then develop a greedy algorithm which traverses the program dependence graph to group statements together under the same loop nest legally to promote maximal reuse per unit of memory occupied. We implemented our framework in Petit a tool for dependence analysis and loop transformations. We compared our method with one based on tiling of fused loop nest and one based on a greedy strategy to purely maximize reuse. We show that our methods work better than both of these strategies in most cases for processors such as TMS320Cxx which have a very limited amount of on-chip memory. The improvements in data I/O range from 10 to 30 percent over tiling and from 10 to 40 percent over maximal reuse for JPEG loops,"['loop restructuring', 'data I/O minimization', 'on-chip memory', 'data traffic', 'embedded processors', 'loop fusion', 'data locality', 'program dependence graph', 'Petit', 'fused loop nest', 'closeness factor', 'DSP', 'embedded systems', 'graph theory', 'microprocessor chips', 'program control structures', 'storage management chips']",224,17
1220,1383,Semantic data broadcast for a mobile environment based on dynamic and adaptive chunking Database broadcast is an effective and scalable approach to disseminate information of high affinity to a large collection of mobile clients. A common problem of existing broadcast approaches is the lack of knowledge for a client to determine if all data items satisfying its query could be obtained from the broadcast. We therefore propose a semantic-based broadcast approach. A semantic descriptor is attached to each broadcast unit called a data chunk. This semantic descriptor allows a client to determine if a query can be answered entirely based on broadcast items and if needed identify the precise definition of the remaining items in the form of a supplementary query. Data chunks can be of static or dynamic sizes and organized hierarchically. Their boundary can be determined on-the-fly adaptive to the nature of client queries. We investigate different ways of organizing the data chunks over a broadcast channel to improve access performance. We introduce the data affinity index metric which more accurately reflects client-perceived performance. A simulation model is built to evaluate our semantic-based broadcast schemes,"['mobile databases', 'mobile computing', 'semantic data broadcast', 'mobile clients', 'semantic descriptor', 'data chunking', 'query processing', 'data affinity index', 'adaptive chunking', 'answerability', 'client-server systems', 'data handling', 'database management systems', 'mobile computing', 'query processing']",187,15
1221,1384,Data allocation on wireless broadcast channels for efficient query processing Data broadcast is an excellent method for efficient data dissemination in the mobile computing environment. The application domain of data broadcast will be widely expanded in the near future where the client is expected to perform complex queries or transactions on the broadcast data. To reduce the access latency for processing the complex query it is beneficial to place the data accessed in a query close to each other on the broadcast channel. In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm to determine the allocation of the data on the broadcast channel such that frequently co-accessed data are not only allocated close to each other but also in a particular order which optimizes the performance of query processing. Our mechanism is based on the well-known problem named optimal linear ordering. Experiments are performed to justify the benefit of our approach,"['database broadcasting', 'query processing', 'access time', 'tuning time', 'broadcast program', 'wireless broadcast channels', 'access latency', 'mobile computing', 'broadcast channels', 'database management systems', 'mobile computing', 'query processing', 'radio links', 'trees (mathematics)']",150,14
1222,1385,Cache invalidation and replacement strategies for location-dependent data in mobile environments Mobile location-dependent information services LDISs have become increasingly popular in recent years. However data caching strategies for LDISs have thus far received little attention. In this paper we study the issues of cache invalidation and cache replacement for location-dependent data under a geometric location model. We introduce a new performance criterion called caching efficiency and propose a generic method for location-dependent cache invalidation strategies. In addition two cache replacement policies PA and PAID are proposed. Unlike the conventional replacement policies PA and PAID take into consideration the valid scope area of a data value. We conduct a series of simulation experiments to study the performance of the proposed caching schemes. The experimental results show that the proposed location-dependent invalidation scheme is very effective and the PA and PAID policies significantly outperform the conventional replacement policies,"['mobile computing', 'location-dependent information', 'cache replacement', 'cache invalidation', 'semantic caching', 'performance evaluation', 'mobile location-dependent information services', 'data caching', 'cache storage', 'mobile computing', 'performance evaluation', 'storage management']",146,12

Rulings made by supranational bodies such as the World Trade Organization WTO and rulings determined under the auspices of transnational economic agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA often supersede existing law resulting in obligatory changes to national provincial state and municipal legislation. Just as important is the relationship among private sector companies third party actors such as nongovernmental organizations NGOs and governments.

1230,1395,Work in progress Developing policies for access to government information in the New South Africa Following South Africa's transition to democracy in 1994 the SA government has adopted policies supporting freedom of expression and freedom of access to information. The Bill of Rights in the new Constitution includes a constitutional right of access to information held by the state. Since 1994 various initiatives have been taken by government and other bodies to promote such access. These include moves to reorganize government printing and publishing restructure the government's public information services make government information available on the Internet and extend telephony and Internet access to poor communities. SA's new Legal Deposit Act 1997 makes provision for the creation of official publications depositories. The Promotion of Access to Information Act 2000 was enacted to ensure access to information held by the state and public bodies.

1231,1396,Construction of double sampling s-control charts for agile manufacturing Double sampling DS X-control charts are designed to allow quick detection of a small shift of process mean and provides a quick response in an agile manufacturing environment. However the DS X-control charts assume that the process standard deviation remains unchanged throughout the entire course of the statistical process control. Therefore a complementary DS chart that can be used to monitor the process variation caused by changes in process standard deviation should be developed. In this paper the development of the DS s-charts for quickly detecting small shift in process standard deviation for agile manufacturing is presented. The construction of the DS s-charts is based on the same concepts in constructing the DS X-charts and is formulated as an optimization problem and solved with a genetic algorithm. The efficiency of the DS s-control chart is compared with that of the traditional s-control chart. The results show that the DS s-control charts can be a more economically preferable alternative in detecting small shifts than traditional s-control charts,"['double sampling s-control charts', 'agile manufacturing', 'double sampling X-control charts', 'process mean shift detection', 'process standard deviation', 'statistical process control', 'genetic algorithm', 'genetic algorithms', 'manufacturing processes', 'statistical process control']",175,10
1232,1397,Computer program for calculating the p-value in testing process capability index C/sub pmk Many process capability indices including C/sub p C/sub pk and C/sub pm have been proposed to provide numerical measures on the process potential and performance. Combining the advantages of these indices Pearn et al. 1992 introduced a new capability index called C/sub pmk which has been shown to be a useful capability index for processes with two-sided specification limits. In this paper the authors implement the theory of a testing hypothesis using the natural estimator of C/sub pmk and provide an efficient Maple computer program to calculate the p-values. They also provide tables of the critical values for some commonly used capability requirements. Based on the test they develop a simple step-by-step procedure for in-plant applications.

Using interactive features-like a poll or quiz-offers your readers an opportunity to become more engaged in your content. Using a survey to gather feedback about your content provides cost-effective data to help make modifications or plot the appropriate course of action. The Web has allowed us to take traditional market research and turn it on its ear. Surveys and polls can be conducted faster and cheaper than with telephone and mail.

Several buyers agree with his observation. They cite aggressive sales tactics an unwillingness to deliver content in formats buyers need a reluctance to provide licensing terms that take into account the structure of today's corporations and inadequate service and support as a few of the factors underlying the acrimony. Still many buyers remain optimistic that compromises can be reached on some of these issues.

1248,1416,Look into the future of content management Predictions of consolidation in the Content Management CM vendor arena have appeared in nearly every major industry prognosis over the past two years. Gartner Group for example recently reiterated its prediction that half the CM vendors in existence in mid-2001 would leave the marketplace by the end of 2002. Analysts consistently advise prospective CM buyers to tread carefully because their vendor may not stick around. But fortunately the story goes fewer vendor choices will finally bring greater clarity and sharper differentiators to this otherwise very messy product landscape. In fact the number of CM vendors continues to rise. Industry growth has come through greater demand among CM buyers but also expanding product functionality as well as successful partnerships. The marketplace certainly cannot sustain its current breadth of vendors in the long run yet it remains unclear when and how any serious industry consolidation will occur. In the meantime evolving business models and feature sets have created just the kind of clearer segmentation and transparent product differences that were supposed to emerge following an industry contraction,"['content management', 'enterprise systems', 'product functionality', 'partnerships', 'industry consolidation', 'information industry', 'information resources', 'Internet']",182,8

What set the proposal apart from what other publishers were doing electronically on the Web was that readers would get the entire version of the paper-including both advertising and editorial just as it looked when it was laid out and went to press. SD Times is only one of a small but growing number of publications that are taking on the electronic world and finding success. In the past six months alone the New York Times Popular Mechanics trade magazine Electronic Buyers News and the Harvard Business Review have launched digital versions of their newspapers and magazines to augment their online and print versions. The reasons are as varied as the publishers themselves. Some companies are finding that readers don't like their Web-based versions either due to poor navigation or missing graphics and images. Others want to expand their publications nationally and internationally but don't want the added cost of postage and printing. Still others are looking for ways to give advertisers additional visibility and boost advertising and subscription revenues.

With constant current bias and constant operating temperature the optical output power and operating wavelength are stable. A simple and inexpensive way is developed to maintain a constant LD temperature as the temperature of the local environment varies by monitoring the initially changing wavelength with an external etalon and using this information to apply a heating correction to the monitor photodiode commonly integral to the LD package.

The impedance of the coil containing the billet was continuously measured by the proposed method in the temperature range between room temperature and 700 degrees C. It was found that the reactance component of the impedance varied distinctively according to the billet state and could clearly monitor the deformation of the billet while the resistance component increased with temperature reflecting the variation of the resistivity of the billet which has strong correlation to the solid/liquid fraction of the billets. The measured impedance is very sensitive to the billet states such as temperature deformation and solid/liquid fraction and could be used as a parameter to monitor and control the heating process for SSMs,"['induction heating process', 'process monitoring', 'process control', 'semisolid alloys', 'semisolid metal casting', 'heating coil sensor', 'coil impedance', 'reactance component', 'billet state', 'billet deformation', 'resistance component', 'resistivity variation', 'solid/liquid fraction', 'solenoid coil', '20 to 700 C', 'casting', 'electric reactance measurement', 'electric resistance measurement', 'induction heating', 'metallurgical industries', 'process control', 'process monitoring', 'solenoids', 'temperature control']",178,24
1268,1436,Modelling tomographic cone-beam projection data from a polyhedral phantom Analytical phantoms are used to generate projection data for testing reconstruction accuracy in computed axial tomography. A circular source locus equivalent to rotating specimen with a fixed source provides insufficient data for exact reconstruction in cone-beam transmission tomography thus phantom data are useful for studying the consequent errors and also for investigating alternative scanning loci and reconstruction techniques. We present an algorithm that can compute phantom cone-beam projection data from a phantom comprising geometrically defined polyhedra. Each polyhedron is defined as a set of polygons enclosing a volume of fixed linear attenuation coefficient. The algorithm works by projecting each polygon in turn onto the modelled detector array which accumulates the product of source to polygon intersection distance for the rays intersecting each detector element linear attenuation coefficient and sign of projected polygon area indicating whether rays enter or exit the polyhedron at this face). The phantom data are rotated according to the projection angle whilst the source location and detector plane remain fixed. Polyhedra can be of simple geometric form or complex surfaces derived from 3D images of real specimens. This algorithm is illustrated using a phantom comprising 989 238 polygons representing an iso-surface generated from a microtomographic reconstruction of a piece of walrus tusk,"['tomographic cone-beam projection data', 'polyhedral phantom', 'reconstruction accuracy', 'computed axial tomography', 'cone-beam transmission tomography', 'alternative scanning loci', 'geometrically defined polyhedra', 'linear attenuation coefficient', 'microtomographic reconstruction', 'walrus tusk', 'reconstruction software accuracy', 'X-ray attenuation', 'cumulative pixel array', 'interpolation', 'geometry file', 'computational geometry', 'computerised tomography', 'image reconstruction', 'interpolation', 'medical image processing', 'surface fitting']",214,21

1270,1438,Three-dimensional particle image tracking for dilute particle-liquid flows in a pipe A three-dimensional 3D particle image tracking technique was used to study the coarse spherical particle-liquid flows in a pipe. The flow images from both the front view and the normal side view which was reflected into the front view by a mirror were recorded with a CCD camera and digitized by a PC with an image grabber card. An image processing program was developed to enhance and segment the flow image and then to identify the particles. Over 90 of all the particles can be identified and located from the partially overlapped particle images using the circular Hough transform. Then the 3D position of each detected particle was determined by matching its front view image to its side view image. The particle velocity was then obtained by pairing its images in successive video fields. The measurements for the spherical expanded polystyrene particle-oil flows show that the particles like the spherical bubbles in laminar bubbly flows tend to conglomerate near the pipe wall and to line up to form the particle clusters. As liquid velocity decreases the particle clusters disperse and more particles are distributed in the pipe centre region,"['three-dimensional particle image tracking', 'dilute particle-liquid flows', 'two-phase flow', 'pipe flow', 'stereo-imaging technique', 'phase distribution', 'CCD camera', '3D position', 'spherical expanded polystyrene particle', 'particle clusters', 'spherical bubble', 'Wiener filter', 'image segmentation', 'region growing technique', 'image recognition', 'image matching', 'Hough transform', 'CCD image sensors', 'flow visualisation', 'Hough transforms', 'image recognition', 'image segmentation', 'mechanical engineering computing', 'optical images', 'physics computing', 'pipe flow', 'stereo image processing', 'tracers', 'two-phase flow', 'velocity measurement']",200,30
1271,1439,On-line robust processing techniques for elimination of measurement drop-out When processing measurement data it is usually assumed that some amount of normally distributed measurement noise is present. In some situations outliers are present in the measurements and consequently the noise is far from normally distributed. In this case classical least-squares procedures for estimating Fourier spectra or derived quantities like the frequency response function can give results which are inaccurate or even useless. In this paper a novel technique for the on-line processing of measurement outliers will be proposed. Both the computation speed and the accuracy of the technique presented will be compared with different classical approaches for handling outliers in measurement data i.e. filtering techniques outlier rejection techniques and robust regression techniques). In particular all processing techniques will be validated by applying them to the problem of speckle drop-out in optical vibration measurements performed with a laser Doppler vibrometer which typically causes outliers in the measurements,"['on-line robust processing techniques', 'measurement dropout elimination', 'normally distributed measurement noise', 'classical least-squares procedures', 'Fourier spectra', 'frequency response function', 'measurement outliers', 'computation speed', 'speckle dropout', 'optical vibration measurements', 'laser Doppler vibrometer', 'laser interferometer', 'modal analysis', 'vibration velocity', 'iterative technique', 'low-pass filtering', 'median filtering', 'robust regression', 'signal sampling', 'order statistics', 'sinusoidal excitation', 'broadband excitation', 'frequency spectra', 'filtering theory', 'frequency response', 'iterative methods', 'laser velocimetry', 'least squares approximations', 'light interferometry', 'low-pass filters', 'measurement errors', 'median filters', 'modal analysis', 'random noise', 'signal sampling', 'statistical analysis', 'vibration measurement']",156,37

1273,1441,Handles and exception safety Part 1. A simple handle class Every C++ program that uses inheritance must manage memory somehow. The most obvious way to do so is directly but programmers who create complicated data structures often have trouble figuring out what parts of those data structures are safe to delete when. The classical method of dealing with such complexity is to hide it in a class. Such classes are typically called handles the idea is to attach a handle object to another object that contains the actual data. The simplest form of a handle which we have discussed in this article is one in which each handle object corresponds to a single object from the inheritance hierarchy. Such handles are straightforward to use and to implement and tend to be intrinsically exception safe in almost all respects. The one exception hazard in such a class is typically the assignment operator. Assignment operators often test for self-assignment to avoid aliasing problems. As Herb Sutter has observed 2000 programs that need such tests are almost always exception unsafe. By rewriting the assignment operator we ensure that we do not do anything irrevocable until the possibility of throwing an exception has passed. This strategy ensures that if an exception occurs while our assignment operator is executing we do not corrupt the rest of our system,"['handles', 'assignment operator', 'self-assignment', 'aliasing problems', 'exception', 'C++ program', 'inheritance hierarchy', 'C++ language', 'exception handling', 'inheritance', 'object-oriented programming', 'storage management']",223,12
1274,1442,Using constructed types in C++ unions The C++ Standard states that a union type cannot have a member with a nontrivial constructor or destructor. While at first this seems unreasonable further thought makes it clear why this is the case The crux of the problem is that unions don't have built-in semantics for denoting when a member is the current member of the union. Therefore the compiler can't know when it's appropriate to call constructors or destructors on the union members. Still there are good reasons for wanting to use constructed object types in a union. For example you might want to implement a scripting language with a single variable type that can either be an integer a string or a list. A union is the perfect candidate for implementing such a composite type but the restriction on constructed union members may prevent you from using an existing string or list class for example from the STL to provide the underlying functionality. Luckily a feature of C++ called placement new can provide a workaround,"['C++ Standard', 'union type', 'constructors', 'destructors', 'union members', 'scripting language', 'placement new', 'C++ language', 'type theory']",174,9
1275,1443,C and C++ a case for compatibility Modern C and C++ are sibling languages descended from Classic C.

Previously the author described some of the incompatibilities that complicate the work of developers within that C/C++ community. In this article he discusses some of the underlying myths that help perpetuate these incompatibilities.

1278,1446,The Tattletale technique Practical experience has taught many Java developers one thing critical resources mutexes database connections transactions file handles etc. require timely and systematic release. Unfortunately Java's garbage collector is not up to that job. According to the Java Language Specification there are no guarantees when a garbage collector will run when it will collect an object or when it will finalize an object  if ever. Even more unfortunately Java's counterpart to the C++ destructor the finally block is both tedious and error-prone requiring developers to constantly remember and duplicate resource-releasing code. Consequently even good Java developers can forget to release critical resources. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. Java may make it easier to leak critical resources but it also provides the necessary mechanisms to easily track them down. The Tattletale technique is a simple method for designing new classes and retrofitting existing classes to quickly and easily detect the offending code responsible for leaking resources,"['Java', 'critical resources', 'mutexes', 'database connections', 'transactions', 'file handles', 'garbage collector', 'resource-releasing code', 'Tattletale technique', 'resources leaking', 'Java', 'program diagnostics', 'storage management']",162,13
1279,1447,International swinging making Swing components locale-sensitive Although Java and its GUI library Swing provide software developers with a highly customizable framework for creating truly international applications the Swing library is not sensitive to locale switches it cannot automatically change an application's appearance to conform to the conventions of a specific locale at run time. Several types of applications benefit from the ability to easily switch the language at run time. Training applications and other programs that run on computers in public spaces such as libraries airports or government offices may need to support multiple languages. Other applications like travel dictionaries or translation programs are inherently multilingual and are specifically designed to support users of dissimilar tongues. Such applications would greatly benefit if the user-interface language could be customized at run time. The article shows you how to customize Swing to support locale switching at run time. The author has created a new look-and-feel called the MLMetalLookandFeel where ML stands for multilingual). This new look-and-feel extends the standard Metal look-and-feel but is locale-sensitive at run time,"['Java', 'GUI library', 'Swing library', 'travel dictionaries', 'translation programs', 'user-interface language', 'locale switching', 'MLMetalLookandFeel', 'graphical user interfaces', 'Java', 'object-oriented programming', 'software architecture', 'software libraries']",175,13
1280,1448,Implementing equals for mixed-type comparison The idea of comparing objects of different types is not entirely off base in particular for classes from the same class hierarchy. After all objects from the same class hierarchy and by class hierarchy we mean all classes derived from a common superclass other than Object have something in common namely at least the superclass part. As we demonstrated in a previous paper 2002 providing a correct implementation of a mixed-type comparison is a non-trivial task. In this article we will show one way of implementing a mixed-type comparison of objects from the same class hierarchy that meets the requirements of the equals contract,"['Java', 'equals contract', 'transitivity requirement', 'mixed-type comparison', 'superclass', 'Java', 'object-oriented programming']",109,7
1281,1449,Raising the standard of management education for electronic commerce professionals The teaching of electronic commerce in universities has become a growth industry in itself. The rapid expansion of electronic commerce programmes raises the question of what actually is being taught. The association of electronic commerce as primarily a technical or information technology IT phenomenon has not been sufficient to constrain it to IT and information systems departments. Business schools have been keen entrants into the electronic commerce coursework race and they are developing electronic commerce programmes in an environment where there is no agreed definition of the term. This paper draws on the work of Kenneth Boulding who argued that the dynamics of change in society are largely a product of changing skills and the way these skills are arranged into roles at the organizational level. It is argued that an overly technical interpretation of electronic commerce narrows the skills being acquired as part of formal education. Universities under pressure from the market and technological change are changing their roles resulting in a further narrowing of the breadth of issues that is seen as legitimate to be included as electronic commerce. The outcome is that aspiring electronic commerce professionals are not being exposed to a wide enough agenda of ideas and concepts that will assist them to make better business decisions,"['electronic commerce professionals', 'universities', 'information technology', 'IT', 'information systems', 'business schools', 'management education standards improvement', 'organizational level', 'formal education', 'Kenneth Boulding', 'accreditation', 'computer science education', 'electronic commerce', 'management education', 'professional aspects', 'standards', 'teaching']",221,17

1284,1452,Creating Web-based listings of electronic journals without creating extra work Creating up-to-date listings of electronic journals is challenging due to frequent changes in titles available and in URLs for electronic journal titles. However many library users may want to browse Web pages which contain listings of electronic journals arranged by title and/or academic disciplines. This case study examines the development of a system which automatically exports data from the online catalog and incorporates it into dynamically-generated Web sites. These sites provide multiple access points for journals include Web-based interfaces enabling subject specialists to manage the list of titles which appears in their subject area. Because data are automatically extracted from the catalog overlap in updating titles and URLs is avoided. Following the creation of this system usage of electronic journals dramatically increased and feedback has been positive. Future challenges include developing more frequent updates and motivating subject specialists to more regularly monitor new titles,"['Web-based listings', 'electronic journals', 'URL', 'library', 'technical services', 'public services partnerships', 'Web pages', 'case study', 'online catalog', 'Web sites', 'feedback', 'cataloguing', 'electronic publishing', 'information resources', 'Internet', 'library automation']",154,16
1285,1453,Mobile banking's tough sell Banks are having to put their mobile-commerce projects on hold because the essential technology to make the services usable in particular GPRS general packet radio service hasn't become widely available. It is estimated that by the end of 2002 only 5 per cent of adults will have GPRS phones. This will have a knock-on effect for other technologies such as clickable icons and multimedia messaging. In fact banking via WAP wireless application protocol has proved to be a frustrating and time-consuming process for the customer. Financial firms hopes for higher mobile usage are stymied by the fact that improvements to the systems won't happen as fast as they want and the inadequacies of the system go beyond immature technology. Financial services institutions should not wait for customers to become au fait with their WAP.

Considering the line of action as a first order singularity of a certain operator equation we develop first and second order conditions for a pair of generated gear tooth flanks to be in contact. The constructive approach allows the direct computation of the paths of contact as the solution of a nonlinear equation system including the exact determination of the bounds of the paths of contact. The transmission error as well as curvature properties in the contact points are obtained in a convenient way. The resulting contact ellipses approximate the bearing area.

1290,1459,Wave propagation related to high-speed train. A scaled boundary FE-approach for unbounded domains Analysis of wave propagation in solid materials under moving loads is a topic of great interest in railway engineering. The objective of the paper is three-dimensional modelling of high-speed train related ground vibrations in particular the question of how to account for the unbounded media is addressed. For efficient and accurate modelling of railway structural components taking the unbounded media into account a hybrid method based on a combination of the conventional finite element method and scaled boundary finite element method is established. In the paper element matrices and solution procedures for the scaled boundary finite element method SBFEM are derived. A non-linear finite element iteration scheme using Lagrange multipliers and coupling between the unbounded domain and the finite element domain are also discussed.

In this technique the detection problem is formulated as an optimization problem minimizing the difference between the measured and calculated surface displacement response derived from scattered elastic-wave fields. A combined optimization technique using an improved mu GA and a local optimizer is developed to solve the optimization problem so as to obtain the flaw parameters defining flaw configurations. Guidelines for implementing the detection technique including formulation of the objective function of the optimization problem using different error norms improvement of mu GA convergence performance switching from mu GA to local optimizer in the optimization process and suppression of the effect of noise on detection results are addressed in detail.

1293,1462,Non-linear analysis of nearly saturated porous media theoretical and numerical formulation A formulation for a porous medium saturated with a compressible fluid undergoing large elastic and plastic deformations is presented. A consistent thermodynamic formulation is proposed for the two-phase mixture problem thus preserving a straightforward and robust numerical scheme. A novel feature is the specification of the fluid compressibility in terms of a volumetric logarithmic strain which is energy conjugated to the fluid pressure in the entropy inequality. As a result the entropy inequality is used to separate three different mechanisms representing the response effective stress response according to Terzaghi in the solid skeleton fluid pressure response to compressibility of the fluid and dissipative Darcy flow representing the interaction between the two phases. The paper is concluded with a couple of numerical examples that display the predictive capabilities of the proposed formulation.

1294,1463,Computational complexity of probabilistic disambiguation Recent models of natural language processing employ statistical reasoning for dealing with the ambiguity of formal grammars. In this approach statistics concerning the various linguistic phenomena of interest are gathered from actual linguistic data and used to estimate the probabilities of the various entities that are generated by a given grammar e.g. derivations parse-trees and sentences. The extension of grammars with probabilities makes it possible to state ambiguity resolution as a constrained optimization formula which aims at maximizing the probability of some entity that the grammar generates given the input e.g. maximum probability parse-tree given some input sentence). The implementation of these optimization formulae in efficient algorithms however does not always proceed smoothly. In this paper we address the computational complexity of ambiguity resolution under various kinds of probabilistic models. We provide proofs that some frequently occurring problems of ambiguity resolution are NP-complete. These problems are encountered in various applications e.g. language understanding for textand speech-based applications. Assuming the common model of computation this result implies that for many existing probabilistic models it is not possible to devise tractable algorithms for solving these optimization problems,"['natural language processing', 'statistical reasoning', 'formal grammars', 'statistics', 'computational complexity', 'probabilistic disambiguation', 'NP-completeness results', 'parsing problems', 'speech processing', 'state ambiguity resolution', 'constrained optimization formula', 'probabilistic models', 'language understanding', 'computational complexity', 'grammars']",190,15
1295,1464,LR parsing for conjunctive grammars The generalized LR parsing algorithm for context-free grammars introduced by Tomita in 1986 is a polynomial-time implementation of nondeterministic LR parsing that uses graph-structured stack to represent the contents of the nondeterministic parser's pushdown for all possible branches of computation at a single computation step. It has been specifically developed as a solution for practical parsing tasks arising in computational linguistics and indeed has proved itself to be very suitable for natural language processing. Conjunctive grammars extend context-free grammars by allowing the use of an explicit intersection operation within grammar rules. This paper develops a new LR-style parsing algorithm for these grammars which is based on the very same idea of a graph-structured pushdown where the simultaneous existence of several paths in the graph is used to perform the mentioned intersection operation. The underlying finite automata are treated in the most general way instead of showing the algorithm's correctness for some particular way of constructing automata the paper defines a wide class of automata usable with a given grammar which includes not only the traditional LR(k automata but also for instance a trivial automaton with a single reachable state. A modification of the SLR(k table construction method that makes use of specific properties of conjunctive grammars is provided as one possible way of making finite automata to use with the algorithm,"['conjunctive grammars', 'generalized LR parsing algorithm', 'graph-structured stack', 'nondeterministic parser pushdown', 'computation', 'computational linguistics', 'natural language processing', 'context-free grammars', 'explicit intersection operation', 'grammar rules', 'finite automata', 'trivial automaton', 'single reachable state', 'Boolean closure', 'deterministic context-free languages', 'computational linguistics', 'context-free grammars', 'context-free languages', 'pushdown automata']",226,19
1296,1465,P systems with symport/antiport rules the traces of objects We continue the study of those P systems where the computation is performed by the communication of objects that is systems with symport and antiport rules. Instead of the number of objects collected in a specified membrane as the result of a computation we consider the itineraries of a certain object through membranes during a halting computation written as a coding of the string of labels of the visited membranes. The family of languages generated in this way is investigated with respect to its place in the Chomsky hierarchy. When the symport and antiport rules are applied in a conditional manner promoted or inhibited by certain objects which should be present in the membrane where a rule is applied then a characterization of recursively enumerable languages is obtained the power of systems with the rules applied freely is only partially described,"['P systems', 'object communication', 'object traces', 'antiport rules', 'symport rules', 'itineraries', 'halting computation', 'label string coding', 'languages', 'Chomsky hierarchy', 'recursively enumerable languages', 'computational linguistics', 'grammars']",150,13

In this paper we formulated the generalized Feldkamp algorithm in the case of equiangular cone-beam projection data and performed numerical simulation to evaluate the image quality.

In 3 method-of-adjustment procedure experiments 8 participants matched the disparity of a circular probe and a planar stimulus rendered using a single visible edge. The experiments varied stimulus orientation and surface texture. Participants more accurately matched the depth of vertical stimuli than that of horizontal stimuli consistent with previous studies and existing theory. Participants matched the depth of surfaces with large pixel-to-pixel luminance variations more accurately than they did surfaces with a small pixel-to-pixel luminance variation. Finally they matched the depth of surfaces with vertical line patterns more accurately than they did surfaces with horizontal-striped texture patterns. These results suggest that designers can enhance depth perception in stereoscopic displays and also reduce undesirable sensitivity to orientation by rendering objects with surface textures using large pixel-to-pixel luminance variations,"['surface textures', 'robustness', 'stereoscopic depth cues', 'circular probe disparity', 'planar stimulus disparity', 'single visible edge', 'stimulus orientation', 'surface texture', 'pixel-to-pixel luminance variations', 'vertical line patterns', 'horizontal-striped texture patterns', 'depth perception', 'stereoscopic displays', 'orientation sensitivity reduction', 'object rendering', 'human factors', 'rendering (computer graphics)', 'three-dimensional displays']",154,18
1304,1473,Control performance with three translational degrees of freedom For multiple degree-of-freedom DOF systems it is important to determine how accurately operators can control each DOF and what influence perceptual information processing and psychomotor components have on performance. Sixteen right-handed male students participated in 2 experiments 1 involving positioning and 1 involving tracking with 3 translational DOFs. To separate perceptual and psychomotor effects we used 2 control-display mappings that differed in the coupling of vertical and depth dimensions to the up-down and fore-aft control axes. We observed information processing effects in the positioning task Initial error correction on the vertical dimension lagged in time behind the horizontal dimension. The depth dimension error correction lagged behind both which was ascribed to the poorer perceptual information. We observed this perceptual effect also in the tracking experiment. Motor effects were also present with tracking errors along the up-down axis of the hand controller being 1.1 times larger than along the fore-aft axis. These results indicate that all 3 components contribute to control performance.

1305,1474,Contrast sensitivity in a dynamic environment effects of target conditions and visual impairment Contrast sensitivity was determined as a function of target velocity 0 degrees 120 degrees s over a variety of viewing conditions. In Experiment 1 measurements of dynamic contrast sensitivity were determined for observers as a function of target velocity for letter stimuli. Significant main effects were found for target velocity target size and target duration but significant interactions among the variables indicated especially pronounced adverse effects of increasing target velocity for small targets and brief durations. In Experiment 2 the effects of simulated cataracts were determined. Although the simulated impairment had no effect on traditional acuity scores dynamic contrast sensitivity was markedly reduced. Results are discussed in terms of dynamic contrast sensitivity as a useful composite measure of visual functioning that may provide a better overall picture of an individual's visual functioning than does traditional static acuity dynamic acuity or contrast sensitivity alone. The measure of dynamic contrast sensitivity may increase understanding of the practical effects of various conditions such as aging or disease on the visual system or it may allow improved prediction of individuals performance in visually dynamic situations,"['contrast sensitivity', 'dynamic environment', 'target conditions', 'visual impairment', 'dynamic contrast sensitivity', 'target velocity', 'target size', 'target duration', 'acuity scores', 'aging', 'disease', 'human factors', 'vision defects', 'visual perception']",194,14
1306,1475,Relation between glare and driving performance The present study investigated the effects of discomfort glare on driving behavior. Participants old and young US and Europeans were exposed to a simulated low beam light source mounted on the hood of an instrumented vehicle. Participants drove at night in actual traffic along a track consisting of urban rural and highway stretches. The results show that the relatively low glare source caused a significant drop in detecting simulated pedestrians along the roadside and made participants drive significantly slower on dark and winding roads. Older participants showed the largest drop in pedestrian detection performance and reduced their driving speed the most. The results indicate that the de Boer rating scale the most commonly used rating scale for discomfort glare is practically useless as a predictor of driving performance. Furthermore the maximum US headlamp intensity 1380 cd per headlamp appears to be an acceptable upper limit,"['glare', 'driving performance', 'discomfort glare', 'simulated low-beam light source', 'road traffic', 'urban road', 'rural road', 'highway', 'deBoer rating scale', 'human factors', 'road vehicles', 'visual perception']",151,12
1307,1476,The perceived utility of human and automated aids in a visual detection task Although increases in the use of automation have occurred across society research has found that human operators often underutilize disuse and overly rely on misuse automated aids Parasuraman-Riley 1997)). Nearly 275 Cameron University students participated in 1 of 3 experiments performed to examine the effects of perceived utility Dzindolet et al. 2001 on automation use in a visual detection task and to compare reliance on automated aids with reliance on humans. Results revealed a bias for human operators to rely on themselves. Although self-report data indicate a bias toward automated aids over human aids performance data revealed that participants were more likely to disuse automated aids than to disuse human aids. This discrepancy was accounted for by assuming human operators have a perfect automation schema.

EID has been applied to industry-scale problems in a broad variety of application domains e.g. process control aviation computer network management software engineering medicine command and control and information retrieval and has consistently led to the identification of new information requirements. An experimental evaluation of EID using a full-fidelity simulator with professional workers has yet to be conducted although some are planned.

1309,1478,The effects of work pace on within-participant and between-participant keying force electromyography and fatigue A laboratory study was conducted to determine the effects of work pace on typing force electromyographic EMG activity and subjective discomfort. We found that as participants typed faster their typing force and finger flexor and extensor EMG activity increased linearly. There was also an increase in subjective discomfort with a sharp threshold between participants self-selected pace and their maximum typing speed. The results suggest that participants self-select a typing pace that maximizes typing speed and minimizes discomfort. The fastest typists did not produce significantly more finger flexor EMG activity but did produce proportionately less finger extensor EMG activity compared with the slower typists. We hypothesize that fast typists may use different muscle recruitment patterns that allow them to be more efficient than slower typists at striking the keys. In addition faster typists do not experience more discomfort than slow typists. These findings show that the relative pace of typing is more important than actual typing speed with regard to discomfort and muscle activity. These results suggest that typists may benefit from skill training to increase maximum typing speed. Potential applications of this research includes skill training for typists,"['work pace effect', 'EMG activity', 'subjective discomfort', 'finger flexor', 'typing speed', 'discomfort', 'typists', 'muscle recruitment patterns', 'keying force', 'skill training', 'electromyography', 'ergonomics', 'human factors', 'man-machine systems']",202,14
1310,1479,Agreeing with automated diagnostic aids a study of users concurrence strategies Automated diagnostic aids that are less than perfectly reliable often produce unwarranted levels of disuse by operators. In the present study users tendencies to either agree or disagree with automated diagnostic aids were examined under conditions in which 1 the aids were less than perfectly reliable but aided-diagnosis was still more accurate that unaided diagnosis and 2 the system was completely opaque affording users no additional information upon which to base a diagnosis. The results revealed that some users adopted a strategy of always agreeing with the aids thereby maximizing the number of correct diagnoses made over several trials. Other users however adopted a probability-matching strategy in which agreement and disagreement rates matched the rate of correct and incorrect diagnoses of the aids. The probability-matching strategy therefore resulted in diagnostic accuracy scores that were lower than was maximally possible. Users who adopted the maximization strategy had higher self-ratings of problem-solving and decision-making skills were more accurate in estimating aid reliabilities and were more confident in their diagnosis on trials in which they agreed with the aids. The potential applications of these findings include the design of interface and training solutions that facilitate the adoption of the most effective concurrence strategies by users of automated diagnostic aids,"['automated diagnostic aids', 'user concurrence strategy', 'probability-matching', 'disagreement rates', 'maximization', 'problem-solving', 'reliability', 'complex systems', 'fault diagnosis', 'automatic test equipment', 'human factors', 'large-scale systems', 'probability', 'reliability']",217,14
1311,1480,Formal verification of human-automation interaction This paper discusses a formal and rigorous approach to the analysis of operator interaction with machines. It addresses the acute problem of detecting design errors in human-machine interaction and focuses on verifying the correctness of the interaction in complex and automated control systems. The paper describes a systematic methodology for evaluating whether the interface provides the necessary information about the machine to enable the operator to perform a specified task successfully and unambiguously. It also addresses the adequacy of information provided to the user via training materials e.g. user manual about the machine's behavior. The essentials of the methodology which can be automated and applied to the verification of large systems are illustrated by several examples and through a case study of pilot interaction with an autopilot aboard a modern commercial aircraft. The expected application of this methodology is an augmentation and enhancement by formal verification of human-automation interfaces,"['formal verification', 'human-automation interaction', 'man-machine interaction', 'automated control systems', 'user interface', 'autopilot', 'commercial aircraft', 'aircraft control', 'formal verification', 'human factors', 'man-machine systems', 'user interfaces']",154,12
1312,1481,Impact of aviation highway-in-the-sky displays on pilot situation awareness Thirty-six pilots 31 men 5 women were tested in a flight simulator on their ability to intercept a pathway depicted on a highway-in-the-sky HITS display. While intercepting and flying the pathway pilots were required to watch for traffic outside the cockpit. Additionally pilots were tested on their awareness of speed altitude and heading during the flight. Results indicated that the presence of a flight guidance cue significantly improved flight path awareness while intercepting the pathway but significant practice effects suggest that a guidance cue might be unnecessary if pilots are given proper training. The amount of time spent looking outside the cockpit while using the HITS display was significantly less than when using conventional aircraft instruments. Additionally awareness of flight information present on the HITS display was poor. Actual or potential applications of this research include guidance for the development of perspective flight display standards and as a basis for flight training requirements,"['flight simulator', 'pilots', 'highway-in-the-sky display', 'cockpit', 'flight guidance', 'human factors', 'situation awareness', 'flight path awareness', 'aircraft display', 'aircraft displays', 'human factors', 'man-machine systems']",162,12

1314,1483,Hypothesis-based concept assignment in software maintenance Software maintenance accounts for a significant proportion of the lifetime cost of a software system. Software comprehension is required in many parts of the maintenance process and is one of the most expensive activities. Many tools have been developed to help the maintainer reduce the time and cost of this task but of the numerous tools and methods available one group has received relatively little attention those using plausible reasoning to address the concept assignment problem. We present a concept assignment method for COBOL II hypothesis-based concept assignment HB-CA). An implementation of a prototype tool is described and results from a comprehensive evaluation using commercial COBOL II sources are summarised. In particular we identify areas of a standard maintenance process where such methods would be appropriate and discuss the potential cost savings that may result,"['hypothesis-based concept assignment', 'software maintenance', 'lifetime cost', 'COBOL II', 'scalability', 'COBOL', 'software engineering', 'software maintenance']",141,8
1315,1484,Portfolio optimization and the random magnet problem Diversification of an investment into independently fluctuating assets reduces its risk. In reality movements of assets are mutually correlated and therefore knowledge of cross-correlations among asset price movements are of great importance. Our results support the possibility that the problem of finding an investment in stocks which exposes invested funds to a minimum level of risk is analogous to the problem of finding the magnetization of a random magnet. The interactions for this random magnet problem are given by the cross-correlation matrix C of stock returns. We find that random matrix theory allows us to make an estimate for C which outperforms the standard estimate in terms of constructing an investment which carries a minimum level of risk,"['portfolio optimization', 'fluctuating assets', 'cross-correlations', 'price movements', 'investment', 'stocks', 'invested funds', 'magnetization', 'cross-correlation matrix', 'minimum risk level', 'spin glasses', 'random magnet problem', 'costing', 'fluctuations', 'investment', 'magnetisation', 'matrix algebra', 'optimisation', 'random processes', 'risk management', 'spin glasses', 'stock markets']",125,22
1316,1485,Telemedicine in the management of a cervical dislocation by a mobile neurosurgeon Neurosurgical teams who are normally located in specialist centres frequently use teleradiology to make a decision about the transfer of a patient to the nearest neurosurgical department. This decision depends on the type of pathology the clinical status of the patient and the prognosis. If the transfer of the patient is not possible for example because of an unstable clinical status a mobile neurosurgical team may be used. We report a case which was dealt with in a remote French military airborne surgical unit in the Republic of Chad. The unit which provides health-care to the French military personnel stationed there also provides free medical care for the local population. It conducts about 100 operations each month. The unit comprises two surgeons an orthopaedic and a general surgeon one anaesthetist two anaesthetic nurses one operating room nurse two nurses three paramedics and a secretary.

It featured a charge-coupled device CCD and corrective optics. Both colour video and digital still images could be taken. The video-camera was connected to a PC with software for database storage image processing and telecommunication. We studied 88 normal subjects 38 male 50 female aged 7-62 years. It was not necessary to use mydriatic eye drops for pupillary dilation. Satisfactory digital images of the whole face and the anterior eye were obtained. The optic disc and the central part of the ocular fundus could also be recorded.

1318,1487,Assessment of prehospital chest pain using telecardiology Two hundred general practitioners were equipped with a portable electrocardiograph which could transmit a 12-lead electrocardiogram ECG via a telephone line. A cardiologist was available 24 h a day for an interactive teleconsultation. In a 13 month period there were 5073 calls to the telecardiology service and 952 subjects with chest pain were identified. The telecardiology service allowed the general practitioners to manage 700 cases 74 themselves further diagnostic tests were requested for 162 patients 17 and 83 patients 9 were sent to the hospital emergency department. In the last group a cardiological diagnosis was confirmed in 60 patients and refuted in 23. Seven patients in whom the telecardiology service failed to detect a cardiac problem were hospitalized in the subsequent 48 h. The telecardiology service showed a sensitivity of 97.4 a specificity of 89.5 and a diagnostic accuracy of 86.9 for chest pain.

1319,1488,Social presence in telemedicine We studied consultations between a doctor emergency nurse practitioners ENPs and their patients in a minor accident and treatment service MATS). In the conventional consultations all three people were located at the main hospital. In the teleconsultations the doctor was located in a hospital 6 km away from the MATS and used a videoconferencing link connected at 384 kbit/s. There were 30 patients in the conventional group and 30 in the telemedical group. The presenting problems were similar in the two groups. The mean duration of teleconsultations was 951 s and the mean duration of face-to-face consultations was 247 s. In doctor-nurse communication there was a higher rate of turn taking in teleconsultations than in face-to-face consultations there were also more interruptions more words and more `backchannels e.g. `mhm `uh-huh per teleconsultation. In doctor-patient communication there was a higher rate of turn taking more words more interruptions and more backchannels per teleconsultation. In patient-nurse communication there was. relatively little difference between the two modes of consulting the doctor. Telemedicine appeared to empower the patient to ask more questions of the doctor. It also seemed that the doctor took greater care in a teleconsultation to achieve coordination of beliefs with the patient than in a face-to-face consultation,"['social presence', 'telemedicine', 'doctor', 'emergency nurse practitioners', 'patients', 'minor accident and treatment service', 'teleconsultations', 'videoconferencing link', 'face-to-face consultations', 'doctor-nurse communication', 'interruptions', 'backchannels', 'words', 'turn taking', 'patient-nurse communication', 'belief coordination', '384 kbit/s', '951 s', '247 s', 'biomedical communication', 'patient care', 'social aspects of automation', 'teleconferencing', 'telemedicine']",210,24

Medical counselling had been granted to 901 of the people requesting it 60%). One hundred and sixty-four physicians formed project groups to process the requests and responded using email. The distribution of patients using the service was similar to the availability of the Internet 78 were from the European Union North America and Australia. Sixty-seven per cent of the patients lived in urban areas and the remainder were residents of remote rural areas with limited local medical coverage. Sixty-five per cent of the requests were about problems of internal medicine and 30 of the requests concerned surgical issues. The remaining 5 of the patients sought information about recent developments such as molecular medicine or aviation medicine.

1321,1490,Client satisfaction in a feasibility study comparing face-to-face interviews with telepsychiatry We carried out a pilot study comparing satisfaction levels between psychiatric patients seen face to face FTF and those seen via videoconference. Patients who consented were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received services in person FTF from the visiting psychiatrist while the other was seen using videoconferencing at 128 kbit/s. One psychiatrist provided all the FTF and videoconferencing assessment and follow-up visits. A total of 24 subjects were recruited. Three of the subjects 13 did not attend their appointments and two subjects in each group were lost to follow-up. Thus there were nine in the FTF group and eight in the videoconferencing group. The two groups were similar in most respects. Patient satisfaction with the services was assessed using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire CSQ-8 completed four months after the initial consultation. The mean scores were 25.3 in the FTF group and 21.6 in the videoconferencing group. Although there was a trend in favour of the FTF service the difference was not significant. Patient satisfaction is only one component of evaluation.

1322,1491,Evaluation of videoconferenced grand rounds We evaluated various aspects of grand rounds videoconferenced from a tertiary care hospital to a regional hospital in Nova Scotia. During a five-month study period 29 rounds were broadcast 19 in medicine and 10 in cardiology). The total recorded attendance at the remote site was 103 comprising 70 specialists nine family physicians and 24 other health-care professionals. We received 55 evaluations a response rate of 53%. On a five-point Likert scale on which higher scores indicated better quality mean ratings by remote-site participants of the technical quality of the videoconference were 3.0-3.5 with the lowest ratings being for ability to hear the discussion 3.0 and to see visual aids 3.1). Mean ratings for content presentation discussion and educational value were 3.8 or higher. Of the 49 physicians who presented the rounds we received evaluations from 41 a response rate of 84%. The presenters rated all aspects of the videoconference and interaction with remote sites at 3.8 or lower. The lowest ratings were for ability to see the remote sites 3.0 and the usefulness of the discussion 3.4). We received 278 evaluations from participants at the presenting site an estimated response rate of about 55%. The results indicated no adverse opinions of the effect of videoconferencing mean scores 3.1-3.3).

1323,1492,A systematic review of the efficacy of telemedicine for making diagnostic and management decisions We conducted a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the efficacy of telemedicine for making diagnostic and management decisions in three classes of application office/hospital-based store-and-forward and home-based telemedicine. We searched the MEDLINE EMBASE CINAHL and HealthSTAR databases and printed resources and interviewed investigators in the field. We excluded studies where the service did not historically require face-to-face encounters e.g. radiology or pathology diagnosis). A total of 58 articles met the inclusion criteria. The articles were summarized and graded for the quality and direction of the evidence. There were very few high-quality studies. The strongest evidence for the efficacy of telemedicine for diagnostic and management decisions came from the specialties of psychiatry and dermatology. There was also reasonable evidence that general medical history and physical examinations performed via telemedicine had relatively good sensitivity and specificity. Other specialties in which some evidence for efficacy existed were cardiology and certain areas of ophthalmology. Despite the widespread use of telemedicine in most major medical specialties there is strong evidence in only a few of them that the diagnostic and management decisions provided by telemedicine are comparable to face-to-face care,"['telemedicine', 'medical diagnosis', 'management decision making', 'literature review', 'MEDLINE', 'EMBASE', 'CINAHL', 'HealthSTAR', 'psychiatry', 'dermatology', 'cardiology', 'ophthalmology', 'information analysis', 'information services', 'medical computing', 'reviews', 'telemedicine']",201,17
1324,1493,Research into telehealth applications in speech-language pathology A literature review was conducted to investigate the extent to which telehealth has been researched within the domain of speech-language pathology and the outcomes of this research. A total of 13 studies were identified. Three early studies demonstrated that telehealth was feasible although there was no discussion of the cost-effectiveness of this process in terms of patient outcomes. The majority of the subsequent studies indicated positive or encouraging outcomes resulting from telehealth. However there were a number of shortcomings in the research including a lack of cost-benefit information failure to evaluate the technology itself an absence of studies of the educational and informational aspects of telehealth in relation to speech-language pathology and the use of telehealth in a limited range of communication disorders.

Although some vehicles can decide to either generate warnings for the human driver or control the vehicle autonomously they must usually make these decisions in real time with only incomplete information. So human drivers must still maintain control over the vehicle. I sketch a digital driving behavior model.

The Semantic Web offers a solution capturing and exploiting the meaning of terms to transform the Web from a platform that focuses on presenting information to a platform that focuses on understanding and reasoning with information. To support Semantic Web development the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency launched the DARPA Agent Markup Language DAML initiative to fund research in languages tools infrastructure and applications that make Web content more accessible and understandable. Although the US government funds DAML several organizations-including US and European businesses and universities and international consortia such as the World Wide Web Consortium-have contributed to work on issues related to DAML's development and deployment.

1333,1502,Mining open answers in questionnaire data Surveys are important tools for marketing and for managing customer relationships the answers to open-ended questions in particular often contain valuable information and provide an important basis for business decisions. The summaries that human analysts make of these open answers however tend to rely too much on intuition and so aren't satisfactorily reliable. Moreover because the Web makes it so easy to take surveys and solicit comments companies are finding themselves inundated with data from questionnaires and other sources. Handling it all manually would be not only cumbersome but also costly. Thus devising a computer system that can automatically mine useful information from open answers has become an important issue.

Many Web-filtering systems are commercially available and potential users can download trial versions from the Internet. However the techniques these systems use are insufficiently accurate and do not adapt well to the ever-changing Web.

1335,1504,Designing human-centered distributed information systems Many computer systems are designed according to engineering and technology principles and are typically difficult to learn and use. The fields of human-computer interaction interface design and human factors have made significant contributions to ease of use and are primarily concerned with the interfaces between systems and users not with the structures that are often more fundamental for designing truly human-centered systems. The emerging paradigm of human-centered computing HCC)-which has taken many forms-offers a new look at system design. HCC requires more than merely designing an artificial agent to supplement a human agent. The dynamic interactions in a distributed system composed of human and artificial agents-and the context in which the system is situated-are indispensable factors.

1338,1507,Ethnography customers and negotiated interactions at the airport In the late 1990s tightly coordinated airline schedules unraveled owing to massive delays resulting from inclement weather overbooked flights and airline operational difficulties. As schedules slipped the delayed departures and late arrivals led to systemwide breakdowns customers missed their connections and airline work activities fell further out of sync. In offering possible answers we emphasize the need to consider the customer as participant following the human-centered computing model. Our study applied ethnographic methods to understand the airline system domain and the nature of airline delays and it revealed the deficiencies of the airline production system model of operations. The research insights that led us to shift from a production and marketing system perspective to a customer-as-participant view might appear obvious to some readers.

1339,1508,Rats robots and rescue In early May media inquiries started arriving at my office at the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue www.crasar.org). Because I'm CRASAR's director I thought the press was calling to follow up on the recent humanitarian award given to the center's founder John Blitch for successfully using small backpackable robots at the World Trade Center disaster. Instead I found they were asking me to comment on the roborats study in the 2 May 2002 Nature. In this study rats with medial force brain implants underwent operant conditioning to force them into a form of guided behavior one aspect of which was thought useful for search and rescue. The article's closing comment suggested that a guided rat could serve as both a mobile robot and a biological sensor. Although a roboticist by training I'm committed to any technology that will help save lives while reducing the risk to rescuers.

1340,1509,Mathematical modelling of the work of the system of wells in a layer with the exponential law of permeability variation and the mobile liquid interface We construct and study a two-dimensional model of the work of the system of wells in a layer with the mobile boundary between liquids of various viscosity. We use a plunger displacement model of liquids. The boundaries of the filtration region of these liquids are modelled by curves of the Lyapunov class. Unlike familiar work we solve two-dimensonal problems in an inhomogeneous layer when the mobile boundary and the boundaries of the filtration region are modelled by curves of the Lyapunov class.

1341,1510,Estimation of the gradient of the solution of an adjoint diffusion equation by the Monte Carlo method For the case of isotropic diffusion we consider the representation of the weighted concentration of trajectories and its space derivatives in the form of integrals with some weights of the solution to the corresponding boundary value problem and its directional derivative of a convective velocity. If the convective velocity at the domain boundary is degenerate and some other additional conditions are imposed this representation allows us to construct an efficient random walk by spheres and balls algorithm. When these conditions are violated transition to modelling the diffusion trajectories by the Euler scheme is realized and the directional derivative of velocity is estimated by the dependent testing method using the parallel modelling of two closely-spaced diffusion trajectories. We succeeded in justifying this method by statistically equivalent transition to modelling a single trajectory after the first step in the Euler scheme using a suitable weight. This weight also admits direct differentiation with respect to the initial coordinate along a given direction. The resulting weight algorithm for calculating concentration derivatives is especially efficient if the initial point is in the subdomain in which the coefficients of the diffusion equation are constant,"['isotropic diffusion', 'weighted trajectory concentration', 'space derivatives', 'integrals', 'boundary value problem', 'directional derivative', 'convective velocity', 'domain boundary', 'gradient estimation', 'adjoint diffusion equation', 'Monte Carlo method', 'random walk by spheres and balls algorithm', 'diffusion trajectories', 'Euler scheme', 'dependent testing method', 'parallel modelling', 'closely-spaced diffusion trajectories', 'statistically equivalent transition', 'weight', 'direct differentiation', 'initial coordinate', 'concentration derivatives', 'boundary-value problems', 'differentiation', 'diffusion', 'integral equations', 'Monte Carlo methods', 'physics computing', 'random processes']",205,29

We present an interesting property of the new parametrization that it guarantees Go continuity on B-spline surfaces when several independently constructed patches are put together without imposing any constraints. Also a simple blending method of patchwork is proposed to construct C/sup n-1 surfaces where overlapping control nets are utilized. It takes into account the semi-localness property of universal parametrization. It effectively helps us construct very natural looking B-spline surfaces while keeping the deviation from given data points very low.

Such curves form a subset of rational Bezier curves characterized by control points on radial directions regularly spaced with respect to the polar angle and weights equal to the inverse of the polar radius. We show that this subset encompasses several classical sectrix curves which solve geometrically the problem of dividing an angle into equal spans and also spirals defining the trajectories of particles in central fields.

We consider a given minimization problem P for which a unique solution will be a point delta on the Bezier curve. For the minimization function f two sufficient conditions exist that ensure the uniqueness of the solution namely the concavity of the control polygon of the polynomial and the characteristics of the Polya frequency-control polygon where the minimum coincides with a critical point of the polynomial. The use of the blossoming theory provides us with a useful geometrical interpretation of the minimization problem.

The explicit coefficient matrix of B-spline with equally spaced knot and Bezier curves and surfaces can be obtained by these formulae.

1350,1519,Structural invariance of spatial Pythagorean hodographs The structural invariance of the four-polynomial characterization for three-dimensional Pythagorean hodographs introduced by Dietz et al. 1993 under arbitrary spatial rotations is demonstrated. The proof relies on a factored-quaternion representation for Pythagorean hodographs in three-dimensional Euclidean space-a particular instance of the PH representation map proposed by Choi et al. 2002)-and the unit quaternion description of spatial rotations. This approach furnishes a remarkably simple derivation for the polynomials u(t upsilon t p(t q(t that specify the canonical form of a rotated Pythagorean hodograph in terms of the original polynomials u(t upsilon t p(t q(t and the angle theta and axis n of the spatial rotation.

1351,1520,Uniform hyperbolic polynomial B-spline curves This paper presents a new kind of uniform splines called hyperbolic polynomial B-splines generated over the space Omega =span{sinh t cosh t t/sup k-3 t/sup k-3 t/sup k-4 ... t 1 in which k is an arbitrary integer larger than or equal to 3. Hyperbolic polynomial B-splines share most of the properties of B-splines in polynomial space. We give subdivision formulae for this new kind of curve and then prove that they have variation diminishing properties and the control polygons of the subdivisions converge. Hyperbolic polynomial B-splines can handle freeform curves as well as remarkable curves such as the hyperbola and the catenary.

With respect to L/sub 2 norm this paper presents an approximate method MDR by L/sub 2 that gives an explicit solution to deal with it. The method has good properties of endpoint interpolation continuity of any r s r s>or=0 orders can be preserved at two endpoints respectively. The method in the paper performs multi-degree reduction at one time and does not need stepwise computing. When applied to multi-degree reduction with endpoint continuity of any order the MDR by L/sub 2 obtains the best least squares approximation. Comparison with another method of multi-degree reduction MDR by L/sub infinity  which achieves the nearly best uniform approximation with respect to L/sub infinity  norm is also given.

1354,1523,Process specialization defining specialization for state diagrams A precise definition of specialization and inheritance promises to be as useful in organizational process modeling as it is in object modeling. It would help us better understand maintain reuse and generate process models. However even though object-oriented analysis and design methodologies take full advantage of the object specialization hierarchy the process specialization hierarchy is not supported in major process representations such as the state diagram data flow diagram and UML representations. Partly underlying this lack of support is an implicit assumption that we can always specialize a process by treating it as just another object. We argue in this paper that this is not so straightforward as it might seem we argue that a process-specific approach must be developed. We propose such an approach in the form of a set of transformations which when applied to a process description always result in specialization. We illustrate this approach by applying it to the state diagram representation and demonstrate that this approach to process specialization is not only theoretically possible but shows promise as a method for categorizing and analyzing processes. We point out apparent inconsistencies between our notion of process specialization and existing work on object specialization but show that these inconsistencies are superficial and that the definition we provide is compatible with the traditional notion of specialization,"['process specialization', 'state diagrams', 'inheritance', 'organizational process modeling', 'object-oriented analysis', 'object specialization hierarchy', 'process representation', 'object-oriented design', 'business data processing', 'corporate modelling', 'diagrams', 'inheritance', 'object-oriented methods']",225,13
1355,1524,Organizational design information transfer and the acquisition of rent-producing resources Within the resource-based view of the firm a dynamic story has emerged in which the knowledge accumulated over the history of a firm and embedded in organizational routines and structures influences the firm's ability to recognize the value of new resources and capabilities. This paper explores the possibility of firms to select organizational designs that increase the likelihood that they will recognize and value rent-producing resources and capabilities. A computational model is developed to study the tension between an organization's desire to explore its environment for new capabilities and the organization's need to exploit existing capabilities. Support is provided for the proposition that integration both externally and internally is an important source of dynamic capability. The model provides greater insight into the tradeoffs between these two forms of integration and suggests when one form may be preferred over another. In particular evidence is provided that in uncertain environments the ability to explore possible alternatives is critical while in more certain environments the ability to transfer information internally is paramount,"['organizational design', 'information transfer', 'rent-producing resources', 'computational model', 'uncertain environments', 'probability', 'certain environments', 'social networks', 'business strategy', 'investments', 'commerce', 'economic cybernetics', 'investment', 'probability']",179,14

In order to do so we propose to extend the notion of dependence networks applied to a single agent to dependence graphs applied to an agency).

1357,1526,GK-DEVS Geometric and kinematic DEVS formalism for simulation modeling of 3-dimensional multi-component systems A combined discrete/continuous simulation methodology based on the DEVS discrete event system specification formalism is presented in this paper that satisfies the simulation requirements of 3-dimensional and dynamic systems with multi-components. We propose a geometric and kinematic DEVS GK-DEVS formalism that is able to describe the geometric and kinematic structure of a system and its continuous state dynamics as well as the interaction among the multi-components. To establish one model having dynamic behavior and a particular hierarchical structure the atomic and the coupled model of the conventional DEVS are merged into one model in the proposed formalism. For simulation of the continuous motion of 3-D components the sequential state set is partitioned into the discrete and the continuous state set and the rate of change function over the continuous state set is employed. Although modified from the conventional DEVS formalism the GK-DEVS formalism preserves a hierarchical modular modeling fashion and a coupling scheme. Furthermore for the GK-DEVS model simulation we propose an abstract simulation algorithm called a GK-Simulator in which data and control are separated and events are scheduled not globally but hierarchically so that an object-oriented principle is satisfied.

1359,1528,DEVS simulation of distributed intrusion detection systems An intrusion detection system IDS attempts to identify unauthorized use misuse and abuse of computer and network systems. As intrusions become more sophisticated dealing with them moves beyond the scope of one IDS. The need arises for systems to cooperate with one another to manage diverse attacks across networks. The feature of recent attacks is that the packet delivery is moderately slow and the attack sources and attack targets are distributed. These attacks are called stealthy attacks. To detect these attacks the deployment of distributed IDSs is needed. In such an environment the ability of an IDS to share advanced information about these attacks is especially important. In this research the IDS model exploits blacklist facts to detect the attacks that are based on either slow or highly distributed packets. To maintain the valid blacklist facts in the knowledge base of each IDS the model should communicate with the other IDSs. When attack level goes beyond the interaction threshold ID agents send interaction messages to ID agents in other hosts. Each agent model is developed as an interruptible atomic-expert model in which the expert system is embedded as a model component,"['intrusion detection system', 'IDS', 'intrusions', 'expert system', 'distributed intrusion detection system', 'cooperative intrusion detection', 'warning threshold', 'authorisation', 'computer network management', 'cooperative systems', 'discrete event simulation', 'expert systems']",198,12
1360,1529,Quantized-State Systems A DEVS-approach for continuous system simulation A new class of dynamical systems Quantized State Systems or QSS is introduced in this paper. QSS are continuous time systems where the input trajectories are piecewise constant functions and the state variable trajectories  being themselves piecewise linear functions  are converted into piecewise constant functions via a quantization function equipped with hysteresis. It is shown that QSS can be exactly represented and simulated by a discrete event model within the framework of the DEVS-approach. Further it is shown that QSS can be used to approximate continuous systems thus allowing their discrete-event simulation in opposition to the classical discrete-time simulation. It is also shown that in an approximating QSS some stability properties of the original system are conserved and the solutions of the QSS go to the solutions of the original system when the quantization goes to zero,"['dynamical systems', 'Quantized State Systems', 'continuous time systems', 'piecewise constant functions', 'discrete event model', 'discrete-event simulation', 'continuous time systems', 'discrete event simulation', 'piecewise constant techniques']",145,9

This is the second part of a two-part paper presenting a new methodology for analytically simulating multi-axis machining of complex sculptured surfaces. The first section of this paper offers a detailed explanation of the model calibration procedure. A new methodology is presented for accurately determining the cutting force coefficients for multi-axis machining. The force model presented in Part 1 is reformulated so that the cutting force coefficients account for the effects of feed rate cutting speed and a complex cutting edge design. Experimental results are presented for the calibration procedure. Model verification tests were conducted with these cutting force coefficients. These tests demonstrate that the predicted forces are within 5 of experimentally measured forces. Simulated results are also shown for predicting dynamic cutting forces and static/dynamic tool deflection. The second section of the paper discusses how the modeling methodology can be applied for feed rate scheduling in an industrial application. A case study for process optimization of machining an airfoil-like surface is used for demonstration. Based on the predicted instantaneous chip load and/or a specified force constraint the feed rate scheduling is utilized to increase the metal removal rate.

1365,1534,Generic simulation approach for multi-axis machining. Part 1 modeling methodology This paper presents a new methodology for analytically simulating multi-axis machining of complex sculptured surfaces. A generalized approach is developed for representing an arbitrary cutting edge design and the local surface topology of a complex sculptured surface. A NURBS curve is used to represent the cutting edge profile. This approach offers the advantages of representing any arbitrary cutting edge design in a generic way as well as providing standardized techniques for manipulating the location and orientation of the cutting edge. The local surface topology of the part is defined as those surfaces generated by previous tool paths in the vicinity of the current tool position. The local surface topology of the part is represented without using a computationally expensive CAD system. A systematic prediction technique is then developed to determine the instantaneous tool/part interaction during machining. The methodology employed here determines the cutting edge in-cut segments by determining the intersection between the NURBS curve representation of the cutting edge and the defined local surface topology. These in-cut segments are then utilized for predicting instantaneous chip load static and dynamic cutting forces and tool deflection.

For some uses such as multiple priority schemes different levels of service are desirable. We propose application-level TCP connection management mechanisms for Web servers to provide two different levels of Web service high and low service by setting different time-outs for inactive TCP connections. We evaluated the performance of the mechanism under heavy and light loading conditions on the Web server. Our experiments show that though heavy traffic saturates the network high level class performance is improved by as much as 25-28%.

Multicast is supported by the multicast backbone Mbone which is a special portion of the Internet where this protocol is being deployed. Mbone VC tools are steadily emerging and the user population is growing fast. VC is a fascinating application that has the potential to greatly impact the way we remotely communicate and work. Yet the adoption of VC is not as fast as one could have predicted. Hence it is important to examine the factors that affect a widespread adoption of VC.

1369,1538,A heuristic approach to resource locations in broadband networks In broadband networks such as ATM the importance of dynamic migration of data resources is increasing because of its potential to improve performance especially for transaction processing. In environments with migratory data resources it is necessary to have mechanisms to manage the locations of each data resource. In this paper we present an algorithm that makes use of system state information and heuristics to manage locations of data resources in a distributed network. In the proposed algorithm each site maintains information about state of other sites with respect to each data resource of the system and uses it to find 1 a subset of sites likely to have the requested data resource and 2 the site where the data resource is to be migrated from the current site. The proposed algorithm enhances its effectiveness by continuously updating system state information stored at each site.

1371,1540,"Adaptive thinning for bivariate scattered data This paper studies adaptive thinning strategies for approximating a large set of scattered data by piecewise linear functions over triangulated subsets. Our strategies depend on both the locations of the data points in the plane and the values of the sampled function at these points  adaptive thinning. All our thinning strategies remove data points one by one so as to minimize an estimate of the error that results by the removal of a point from the current set of points this estimate is termed anticipated error""). The thinning process generates subsets of most significant points such that the piecewise linear interpolants over the Delaunay triangulations of these subsets approximate progressively the function values sampled at the original scattered points and such that the approximation errors are small relative to the number of points in the subsets. We design various methods for computing the anticipated error at reasonable cost and compare and test the performance of the methods. It is proved that for data sampled from a convex function with the strategy of convex triangulation the actual error is minimized by minimizing the best performing measure of anticipated error. It is also shown that for data sampled from certain quadratic polynomials adaptive thinning is equivalent to thinning which depends only on the locations of the data points  nonadaptive thinning.

The method belongs to the family of projection type methods. At each step it refines the approximate invariant subspace using a linearized Riccati's equation which turns out to be the block analogue of the correction used in the Jacobi-Davidson method.

Our earlier system GUILD Downing and Zvirinsky Artificial Life 5 p.291-318 1999 displayed emergent regulation of the chemical environment by a population of metabolizing agents but the chemical model underlying those results was trivial essentially admitting all possible reactions at a single energy cost. The new model METAMIC utilizes abstract chemistries that are both a constrained to a small set of legal reactions and b grounded in basic fundamental relationships between energy entropy and biomass synthesis/breakdown. To explore the general phenomena of emergent homeostasis we generate 100 different chemistries and use each as the basis for several METAMIC runs as part of a Gaia hunt. This search discovers 20 chemistries that support microbial populations capable of regulating a physical environmental factor within their growth-optimal range despite the extra metabolic cost. Case studies from the Gaia hunt illustrate a few simple mechanisms by which real biota might exploit the underlying chemistry to achieve some control over their physical environment.

1415,1595,Convergence of finite element approximations and multilevel linearization for Ginzburg-Landau model of d-wave superconductors In this paper we consider the finite element approximations of a recently proposed Ginzburg-Landau-type model for d-wave superconductors. In contrast to the conventional Ginzburg-Landau model the scalar complex valued order-parameter is replaced by a multicomponent complex order-parameter and the free energy is modified according to the d-wave paring symmetry. Convergence and optimal error estimates and some super-convergent estimates for the derivatives are derived.

1418,1598,A decision support model for selecting product/service benefit positionings The art and science of successful product/service positioning generally hinges on the firm's ability to select a set of attractively priced consumer benefits that are valued by the buyer distinctive in one or more respects believable deliverable and sustainable under actual or potential competitive abilities to imitate neutralize or overcome in the target markets that the firm selects. For many years the ubiquitous quadrant chart has been used to provide a simple graph of product/service benefits usually called product/service attributes described in terms of consumers perceptions of the importance of attributes to brand/supplier choice and the performance of competing firms on these attributes. This paper describes a model that extends the quadrant chart concept to a decision support system that optimizes a firm's market share for a specified product/service. In particular we describe a decision support model that utilizes relatively simple marketing research data on consumers judged benefit importances and supplier performances on these benefits to develop message components for specified target buyers. A case study is used to illustrate the model. The study deals with developing advertising message components for a relatively new entrant in the US air shipping market.

1419,1599,Evaluating the best main battle tank using fuzzy decision theory with linguistic criteria evaluation In this paper experts opinions are described in linguistic terms which can be expressed in trapezoidal or triangular fuzzy numbers. To make the consensus of the experts consistent we utilize the fuzzy Delphi method to adjust the fuzzy rating of every expert to achieve the consensus condition. For the aggregate of many experts opinions we take the operation of fuzzy numbers to get the mean of fuzzy rating x/sub ij and the mean of weight w/sub .j/. In multi-alternatives and multi-attributes cases the fuzzy decision matrix X=[x/sub ij/]/sub m*n is constructed by means of the fuzzy rating x/sub ij/. Then we can derive the aggregate fuzzy numbers by multiplying the fuzzy decision matrix with the corresponding fuzzy attribute weights. The final results become a problem of ranking fuzzy numbers. We also propose an easy procedure of using fuzzy numbers to rank aggregate fuzzy numbers A/sub i/. In this way we can obtain the best selection for evaluating the system. For practical application we propose an algorithm for evaluating the best main battle tank by fuzzy decision theory and comparing it with other methods,"['battle tank evaluation', 'fuzzy group decision making', 'fuzzy decision theory', 'linguistic criteria evaluation', 'multiple criteria problems', 'group decision making', 'subjective-objective backgrounds', 'trapezoidal fuzzy numbers', 'triangular fuzzy numbers', 'fuzzy Delphi method', 'fuzzy rating', 'consensus condition', 'fuzzy number ranking', 'fuzzy decision matrix', 'aggregate fuzzy numbers', 'fuzzy attribute weights', 'computational linguistics', 'decision theory', 'fuzzy set theory', 'group decision support systems', 'military computing', 'military systems']",197,22

1422,1602,An optimization approach to plan for reusable software components It is well acknowledged in software engineering that there is a great potential for accomplishing significant productivity improvements through the implementation of a successful software reuse program. On the other hand such gains are attainable only by instituting detailed action plans at both the organizational and program level. Given this need the paucity of research papers related to planning and in particular optimized planning is surprising. This research which is aimed at this gap brings out an application of optimization for the planning of reusable software components SCs). We present a model that selects a set of SCs that must be built in order to lower development and adaptation costs. We also provide implications to project management based on simulation an approach that has been adopted by other cost models in the software engineering literature.

1423,1603,Exploiting structure in adaptive dynamic programming algorithms for a stochastic batch service problem The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the importance of using structural results in dynamic programming algorithms. We consider the problem of approximating optimal strategies for the batch service of customers at a service station. Customers stochastically arrive at the station and wait to be served incurring a waiting cost and a service cost. Service of customers is performed in groups of a fixed service capacity. We investigate the structure of cost functions and establish some theoretical results including monotonicity of the value functions. Then we use our adaptive dynamic programming monotone algorithm that uses structure to preserve monotonicity of the estimates at each iterations to approximate the value functions. Since the problem with homogeneous customers can be solved optimally we have a means of comparison to evaluate our heuristic. Finally we compare our algorithm to classical forward dynamic programming methods,"['stochastic batch service problem', 'adaptive dynamic programming algorithms', 'structural results', 'optimal strategy approximation', 'service station', 'waiting cost', 'service cost', 'fixed service capacity', 'cost function structure', 'value function monotonicity', 'inventory theory', 'dynamic programming', 'queueing theory', 'stochastic processes', 'stock control']",155,15
1424,1604,Improving supply-chain performance by sharing advance demand information In this paper we analyze how sharing advance demand information ADI can improve supply-chain performance. We consider two types of ADI aggregated ADI A-ADI and detailed ADI D-ADI). With A-ADI customers share with manufacturers information about whether they will place an order for some product in the next time period but do not share information about which product they will order and which of several potential manufacturers will receive the order. With D-ADI customers additionally share information about which product they will order but which manufacturer will receive the order remains uncertain. We develop and solve mathematical models of supply chains where ADI is shared. We derive exact expressions and closed-form approximations for expected costs expected base-stock levels and variations of the production quantities. We show that both the manufacturer and the customers benefit from sharing ADI but that sharing ADI increases the bullwhip effect. We also show that under certain conditions it is optimal to collect ADI from either none or all of the customers. We study two supply chains in detail a supply chain with an arbitrary number of products that have identical demand rates and a supply chain with two products that have arbitrary demand rates. For these two supply chains we analyze how the values of A-ADI and D-ADI depend on the characteristics of the supply chain and on the quality of the shared information and we identify conditions under which sharing A-ADI and D-ADI can significantly reduce cost. Our results can be used by decision makers to analyze the cost savings that can be achieved by sharing ADI and help them to determine if sharing ADI is beneficial for their supply chains,"['supply-chain performance improvement', 'advance demand information', 'aggregated ADI', 'detailed ADI', 'information sharing', 'manufacturing', 'mathematical models', 'closed-form approximations', 'expected costs', 'expected base-stock levels', 'production quantity variations', 'bullwhip effect', 'arbitrary product number', 'identical demand rates', 'arbitrary demand rates', 'shared information quality', 'decision makers', 'cost savings', 'forecasting', 'decision theory', 'forecasting theory', 'management science', 'manufacture', 'stock control']",285,24
1425,1605,A GRASP heuristic for the mixed Chinese postman problem Arc routing problems ARPs consist of finding a traversal on a graph satisfying some conditions related to the links of the graph. In the Chinese postman problem CPP the aim is to find a minimum cost tour closed walk traversing all the links of the graph at least once. Both the Undirected CPP where all the links are edges that can be traversed in both ways and the Directed CPP where all the links are arcs that must be traversed in a specified way are known to be polynomially solvable. However if we deal with a mixed graph having edges and arcs the problem turns out to be NP-hard. In this paper we present a heuristic algorithm for this problem the so-called Mixed CPP MCPP based on greedy randomized adaptive search procedure GRASP techniques. The algorithm has been tested and compared with other known and recent methods from the literature on a wide collection of randomly generated instances with up to 200 nodes and 600 links producing encouraging computational results.

1429,1609,Modeling undesirable factors in efficiency evaluation Data envelopment analysis DEA measures the relative efficiency of decision making units DMUs with multiple performance factors which are grouped into outputs and inputs. Once the efficient frontier is determined inefficient DMUs can improve their performance to reach the efficient frontier by either increasing their current output levels or decreasing their current input levels. However both desirable good and undesirable bad factors may be present. For example if inefficiency exists in production processes where final products are manufactured with a production of wastes and pollutants the outputs of wastes and pollutants are undesirable and should be reduced to improve the performance. Using the classification invariance property we show that the standard DEA model can be used to improve the performance via increasing the desirable outputs and decreasing the undesirable outputs. The method can also be applied to situations when some inputs need to be increased to improve the performance. The linearity and convexity of DEA are preserved through our proposal,"['data envelopment analysis', 'decision making units', 'multiple performance factors', 'efficient frontier', 'current output levels', 'current input levels', 'production processes', 'final product manufacture', 'wastes', 'pollutants', 'classification invariance property', 'desirable outputs', 'undesirable outputs', 'linear programming', 'efficiency evaluation', 'undesirable factor modeling', 'data envelopment analysis', 'distributed decision making', 'linear programming', 'production']",166,20

1462,1643,Effectiveness of user testing and heuristic evaluation as a function of performance classification For different levels of user performance different types of information are processed and users will make different types of errors. Based on the error's immediate cause and the information being processed usability problems can be classified into three categories. They are usability problems associated with skill-based rule-based and knowledge-based levels of performance. In this paper a user interface for a Web-based software program was evaluated with two usability evaluation methods user testing and heuristic evaluation. The experiment discovered that the heuristic evaluation with human factor experts is more effective than user testing in identifying usability problems associated with skill-based and rule-based levels of performance. User testing is more effective than heuristic evaluation in finding usability problems associated with the knowledge-based level of performance.

1463,1644,An experimental evaluation of comprehensibility aspects of knowledge structures derived through induction techniques a case study of industrial fault diagnosis Machine induction has been extensively used in order to develop knowledge bases for decision support systems and predictive systems. The extent to which developers and domain experts can comprehend these knowledge structures and gain useful insights into the basis of decision making has become a challenging research issue. This article examines the knowledge structures generated by the C4.5 induction technique in a fault diagnostic task and proposes to use a model of human learning in order to guide the process of making comprehensive the results of machine induction. The model of learning is used to generate hierarchical representations of diagnostic knowledge by adjusting the level of abstraction and varying the goal structures between shallow and deep ones. Comprehensibility is assessed in a global way in an experimental comparison where subjects are required to acquire the knowledge structures and transfer to new tasks. This method of addressing the issue of comprehensibility appears promising especially for machine induction techniques that are rather inflexible with regard to the number and sorts of interventions allowed to system developers,"['experimental evaluation', 'knowledge structure comprehensibility aspects', 'induction techniques', 'case study', 'industrial fault diagnosis', 'knowledge bases', 'decision support systems', 'predictive systems', 'C4.5 induction technique', 'industrial plants', 'human learning model', 'diagnostic knowledge representations', 'decision support systems', 'diagnostic expert systems', 'diagnostic reasoning', 'fault diagnosis', 'industrial plants', 'knowledge representation', 'learning by example']",194,19
1464,1645,Effects of the transition to a client-centred team organization in administrative surveying work A new work organization was introduced in administrative surveying work in Sweden during 1998. The new work organization implied a transition to a client-centred team-based organization and required a change in competence from specialist to generalist knowledge as well as a transition to a new information technology implying a greater integration within the company. The aim of this study was to follow the surveyors for two years from the start of the transition and investigate how perceived consequences of the transition job organizational factors well-being and effectiveness measures changed between 1998 and 2000. The Teamwork Profile and QPS Nordic questionnaire were used. The 205 surveyors who participated in all three study phases constituted the study group. The result showed that surveyors who perceived that they were working as generalists rated the improvements in job and organizational factors significantly higher than those who perceived that they were not yet generalists. Improvements were noted in 2000 in quality of service to clients time available to handle a case and effectiveness of teamwork in a transfer to a team-based work organization group cohesion and continuous improvement practices-for example learning by doing mentoring and guided delegation-were important to improve the social effectiveness of group work,"['client-centred team organization', 'administrative surveying work', 'information technology', 'company', 'job', 'organizational factors', 'effectiveness measures', 'Teamwork Profile', 'QPS Nordic questionnaire', 'social effectiveness', 'public administrative sector', 'human factors', 'human resource management', 'information technology', 'personnel', 'public administration', 'social aspects of automation']",214,17

The first experiment involved upright figures and served to determine baseline point-to-point mapping accuracy which was found to be very good. Three shapes were used square circle and irregularly round. The main experiment with slanted figures involved only two shapes-square and irregularly shaped-showed at several slant degrees. Despite the accumulated evidence for shape constancy when the outline of perspective projections is considered metric perception of the inner structure of such projections was quite limited.

1470,1651,H-matrix approximation for the operator exponential with applications We previously developed a data-sparse and accurate approximation to parabolic solution operators in the case of a rather general elliptic part given by a strongly P-positive operator . Also a class of matrices H-matrices has been analysed which are data-sparse and allow an approximate matrix arithmetic with almost linear complexity. In particular the matrix-vector/matrix-matrix product with such matrices as well as the computation of the inverse have linear-logarithmic cost. In this paper we apply the H-matrix techniques to approximate the exponent of an elliptic operator. Starting with the Dunford-Cauchy representation for the operator exponent we then discretise the integral by the exponentially convergent quadrature rule involving a short sum of resolvents. The latter are approximated by the H-matrices. Our algorithm inherits a two-level parallelism with respect to both the computation of resolvents and the treatment of different time values. In the case of smooth data coefficients boundaries we prove the linear-logarithmic complexity of the method,"['H-matrix approximation', 'operator exponential', 'data-sparse approximation', 'almost linear complexity', 'parabolic solution operators', 'Dunford-Cauchy representation', 'exponentially convergent quadrature rule', 'strongly P-positive operator', 'approximation theory', 'computational complexity', 'differential equations', 'matrix algebra']",163,12

The convergence of u/sub D to u is shown as the size of the space and time steps tend to zero. In a first step estimates on u/sub D are used to prove the convergence up to a subsequence of u/sub D to a measure valued entropy solution called here an entropy process solution). A result of uniqueness of the entropy process solution is proved yielding the strong convergence of u/sub D to u.

1472,1653,The best circulant preconditioners for Hermitian Toeplitz systems.II. The multiple-zero case For pt.I. see SIAM J. Numer. Anal. vol. 38 p. 876-896. Circulant-type preconditioners have been proposed previously for ill-conditioned Hermitian Toeplitz systems that are generated by nonnegative continuous functions with a zero of even order. The proposed circulant preconditioners can be constructed without requiring explicit knowledge of the generating functions. It was shown that the spectra of the preconditioned matrices are uniformly bounded except for a fixed number of outliers and that all eigenvalues are uniformly bounded away from zero. Therefore the conjugate gradient method converges linearly when applied to solving the circulant preconditioned systems. Previously it was claimed that this result can be extended to the case where the generating functions have multiple zeros. The main aim of this paper is to give a complete convergence proof of the method for this class of generating functions,"['circulant preconditioners', 'Hermitian Toeplitz systems', 'multiple-zero case', 'nonnegative continuous functions', 'generating functions', 'preconditioned matrices', 'eigenvalues', 'conjugate gradient method', 'computational complexity', 'conjugate gradient methods', 'eigenvalues and eigenfunctions', 'Hermitian matrices', 'Toeplitz matrices']",148,13

1474,1655,An empirical investigation of the influences of the degree of interactivity on user-outcomes in a multimedia environment The study reported here investigates the influence of interactivity on the learning outcomes of users in a multimedia systems environment. Drawing from past literature base and based on key tenets of three learning theories  behaviorist cognitivist and constructivist  the study first proposes a measurement scheme for interactivity and then hypothesizes that interactivity would influence the learning outcomes positively in terms of users learning achievement and attitude. Three prototypes of a multimedia instructional/training system to represent high low and noninteractive modes of use were developed and implemented and the hypothesized influences were investigated using a controlled laboratory research design. Multiple analysis of variance MANOVA results indicate that while interactivity does not necessarily enable enhanced gain in user learning it positively influences participants attitude. The study finds no support for hypothesized moderating effects of learning styles measured using Kolb's Learning Style Inventory scale on the relationship between interactivity and user outcomes.

1475,1656,Impact of user satisfaction and trust on virtual team members Pressured by the growing need for fast response times mass customization and globalization many organizations are turning to flexible organizational forms such as virtual teams. Virtual teams consist of cooperative relationships supported by information technology to overcome limitations of time and/or location. Virtual teams require their members to rely heavily on the use of information technology and trust in coworkers. This study investigates the impacts that the reliance on information technology operationalized in our study via the user satisfaction construct and trust have on the job satisfaction of virtual team members. The study findings reveal that both user satisfaction and trust are positively related to job satisfaction in virtual teams while system use was not found to play a significant role. These findings emphasize that organizations seeking the benefits of flexible IT-enabled virtual teams must consider both the level of trust among colleagues and the users satisfaction with the information technology on which virtual teams rely,"['information technology', 'trust', 'IT', 'user satisfaction', 'job satisfaction', 'virtual team members', 'business data processing', 'groupware', 'human factors', 'information technology']",166,10
1476,1657,Breaking the myths of rewards an exploratory study of attitudes about knowledge sharing Many CEO and managers understand the importance of knowledge sharing among their employees and are eager to introduce the knowledge management paradigm in their organizations. However little is known about the determinants of the individual's knowledge sharing behavior. The purpose of this study is to develop an understanding of the factors affecting the individual's knowledge sharing behavior in the organizational context. The research model includes various constructs based on social exchange theory self-efficacy and theory of reasoned action. Research results from the field survey of 467 employees of four large public organizations show that expected associations and contribution are the major determinants of the individual's attitude toward knowledge sharing. Expected rewards believed by many to be the most important motivating factor for knowledge sharing are not significantly related to the attitude toward knowledge sharing. As expected positive attitude toward knowledge sharing is found to lead to positive intention to share knowledge and finally to actual knowledge sharing behaviors,"['knowledge sharing', 'knowledge management', 'social exchange theory', 'self-efficacy', 'theory of reasoned action', 'public organizations', 'rewards', 'strategic management', 'information resources', 'information systems', 'social aspects of automation', 'strategic planning']",171,12

1478,1659,Mobile commerce transforming the vision into reality This editorial preface investigates current developments in mobile commerce M-commerce and proposes an integrated architecture that supports business and consumer needs in an optimal way to successfully implement M-commerce business processes. The key line of thought is based on the heuristic observation that customers will not want to receive M-commerce offerings to their mobile telephones. As a result a pull as opposed to a push approach becomes a necessary requirement to conduct M-commerce. In addition M-commerce has to rely on local regional demographic and many other variables to be truly effective. Both observations necessitate an M-commerce architecture that allows the coherent integration of enterprise-level systems as well as the aggregation of product and service offerings from many different and partially competing parties into a collaborative M-commerce platform. The key software component within this integrated architecture is an event management engine to monitor detect store process and measure information about outside events that are relevant to all participants in M-commerce,"['M-commerce', 'mobile commerce', 'integrated architecture', 'consumer needs', 'business needs', 'mobile telephones', 'pull approach', 'collaborative platform', 'event management engine', 'cellular radio', 'electronic commerce', 'integrated software', 'mobile computing']",166,13

1483,1665,How airlines and airports recover from schedule perturbations a survey The explosive growth in air traffic as well as the widespread adoption of Operations Research techniques in airline scheduling has given rise to tight flight schedules at major airports. An undesirable consequence of this is that a minor incident such as a delay in the arrival of a small number of flights can result in a chain reaction of events involving several flights and airports causing disruption throughout the system. This paper reviews recent literature in the area of recovery from schedule disruptions. First we review how disturbances at a given airport could be handled including the effects of runways and fixes. Then we study the papers on recovery from airline schedule perturbations which involve adjustments in flight schedules aircraft and crew.

1488,1670,An integrated optimization model for train crew management Train crew management involves the development of a duty timetable for each of the drivers crew to cover a given train timetable in a rail transport organization. This duty timetable is spread over a certain period known as the roster planning horizon. Train crew management may arise either from the planning stage when the total number of crew and crew distributions are to be determined or from the operating stage when the number of crew at each depot is known as input data. In this paper we are interested in train crew management in the planning stage. In the literature train crew management is decomposed into two stages crew scheduling and crew rostering which are solved sequentially. We propose an integrated optimization model to solve both crew scheduling and crew rostering. The model enables us to generate either cyclic rosters or non-cyclic rosters. Numerical experiments are carried out over data sets arising from a practical application,"['integrated optimization model', 'train crew management', 'duty timetable', 'rail transport organization', 'roster planning horizon', 'crew scheduling', 'crew rostering', 'cyclic rosters', 'noncyclic rosters', 'integer programming', 'human resource management', 'integer programming', 'operations research', 'railways', 'scheduling']",164,15
1489,1671,Cane railway scheduling via constraint logic programming labelling order and constraints in a real-life application In Australia cane transport is the largest unit cost in the manufacturing of raw sugar making up around 35 of the total manufacturing costs. Producing efficient schedules for the cane railways can result in significant cost savings. The paper presents a study using constraint logic programming CLP to solve the cane transport scheduling problem. Tailored heuristic labelling order and constraints strategies are proposed and encouraging results of application to several test problems and one real-life case are presented. The preliminary results demonstrate that CLP can be used as an effective tool for solving the cane transport scheduling problem with a potential decrease in development costs of the scheduling system. It can also be used as an efficient tool for rescheduling tasks which the existing cane transport scheduling system cannot perform well,"['cane railway scheduling', 'constraint logic programming', 'cane transport', 'raw sugar', 'total manufacturing costs', 'cost savings', 'heuristic labelling order', 'constraints strategies', 'agriculture', 'constraint handling', 'constraint theory', 'goods distribution', 'locomotives', 'scheduling']",146,14

1492,1674,A column generation approach to delivery planning over time with inhomogeneous service providers and service interval constraints We consider a problem of delivery planning over multiple time periods. Deliveries must be made to customers having nominated demand in each time period. Demand must be met in each time period by use of some combination of inhomogeneous service providers. Each service provider has a different delivery capacity different cost of delivery to each customer a different utilisation requirement and different rules governing the spread of deliveries in time. The problem is to plan deliveries so as to minimise overall costs subject to demand being met and service rules obeyed. A natural integer programming model was found to be intractable except on problems with loose demand constraints with gaps between best lower bound and best feasible solution of up to 35.1 with an average of 15.4 over the test data set. In all but the problem with loosest demand constraints Cplex 6.5 applied to this formulation failed to find the optimal solution before running out of memory. However a column generation approach improved the lower bound by between 0.6 and 21.9 with an average of 9.9 and in all cases found the optimal solution at the root node without requiring branching,"['column generation approach', 'delivery planning over time', 'inhomogeneous service providers', 'service interval constraints', 'delivery capacity', 'lower bound', 'transportation', 'goods distribution', 'integer programming', 'linear programming']",209,10
1493,1675,An operations research approach to the problem of the sugar cane selection Selection for superior clones is the most important aspect of sugar cane improvement programs and is a long and expensive process. While studies have investigated different components of selection independently there has not been a whole system approach to improve the process. This study observes the problem as an integrated system where if one parameter changes the state of the whole system changes. A computer based stochastic simulation model that accurately represents the selection was developed. The paper describes the simulation model showing its accuracy as well as how a combination of dynamic programming and branch and bound can be applied to the model to optimise the selection system giving a new application of these techniques.

The system automates the train-operator scheduling process at SMRT and produces favorable schedules in comparison with the manual process.

The main difficulty of these solvers is the size of the Grobner bases generated.

1497,1679,Project scheduling under time dependent costs-a branch and bound algorithm In a given project network execution of each activity in normal duration requires utilization of certain resources. If faster execution of an activity is desired then additional resources at extra cost would be required. Given a project network the cost structure for each activity and a planning horizon the project compression problem is concerned with the determination of optimal schedule of performing each activity while satisfying given restrictions and minimizing the total cost of project execution. The paper considers the project compression problem with time dependent cost structure for each activity. The planning horizon is divided into several regular time intervals over which the cost structure of an activity may vary. But the cost structure of the activities remains the same within a time interval. The objective is to find an optimal project schedule minimizing the total project cost. We present a mathematical model for this problem develop some heuristics and an exact branch and bound algorithm.

There are n non-preemptive and simultaneously available jobs. Each job will incur an early tardy penalty if it is early tardy with respect to the common due window under a given schedule. The window size is a given parameter but the window location is a decision variable. The objective of the problem is to find a schedule that minimizes the weighted number of early and tardy jobs and the location penalty. We show that the problem is NP-complete in the ordinary sense and develop a dynamic programming based pseudo-polynomial algorithm.

1509,1694,Product development using a 3D computer model to optimize the stability of the Rocket TM powered wheelchair A three-dimensional 3D lumped-parameter model of a powered wheelchair was created to aid the development of the Rocket prototype wheelchair and to help explore the effect of innovative design features on its stability. The model was developed using simulation software specifically Working Model 3D. The accuracy of the model was determined by comparing both its static stability angles and dynamic behavior as it passed down a 4.8-cm 1.9 road curb at a heading of 45 degrees with the performance of the actual wheelchair. The model's predictions of the static stability angles in the forward rearward and lateral directions were within 9.3 7.1 and 3.8 of the measured values respectively. The average absolute error in the predicted position of the wheelchair as it moved down the curb was 2.2 cm/m 0.9 per 3'3 traveled. The accuracy was limited by the inability to model soft bodies the inherent difficulties in modeling a statically indeterminate system and the computing time. Nevertheless it was found to be useful in investigating the effect of eight design alterations on the lateral stability of the wheelchair. Stability was quantified by determining the static lateral stability angles and the maximum height of a road curb over which the wheelchair could successfully drive on a diagonal heading. The model predicted that the stability was more dependent on the configuration of the suspension system than on the dimensions and weight distribution of the wheelchair. Furthermore for the situations and design alterations studied predicted improvements in static stability were not correlated with improvements in dynamic stability,"['3D computer model', 'product development', 'innovative design features', 'suspension system configuration', 'dynamic stability improvements', 'average absolute error', 'predicted position', 'soft bodies modeling', 'statically indeterminate system', 'computing time', 'design alterations effect', 'diagonal heading', 'weight distribution', 'Rocket TM powered wheelchair', '4.8 cm', 'digital simulation', 'handicapped aids', 'mechanical stability', 'medical computing']",272,19

1516,1701,Estimation of 3-D left ventricular deformation from medical images using biomechanical models The quantitative estimation of regional cardiac deformation from three-dimensional 3-D image sequences has important clinical implications for the assessment of viability in the heart wall. We present here a generic methodology for estimating soft tissue deformation which integrates image-derived information with biomechanical models and apply it to the problem of cardiac deformation estimation. The method is image modality independent. The images are segmented interactively and then initial correspondence is established using a shape-tracking approach. A dense motion field is then estimated using a transversely isotropic linear-elastic model which accounts for the muscle fiber directions in the left ventricle. The dense motion field is in turn used to calculate the deformation of the heart wall in terms of strain in cardiac specific directions. The strains obtained using this approach in open-chest dogs before and after coronary occlusion exhibit a high correlation with strains produced in the same animals using implanted markers. Further they show good agreement with previously published results in the literature.

Considering that X-ray cineangiocardiography is still commonly employed in clinical cardiology and computational costs for 3-D recovery and visualization are rapidly decreasing it is meaningful to develop a clinically applicable system for 3-D LV shape recovery from X-ray cineangiocardiograms. The system is based on a previously reported closed-surface method of shape recovery from two-dimensional occluding contours with multiple views. To apply the method to real LV cineangiocardiograms user-interactive systems were implemented for preprocessing including detection of LV contours calibration of the imaging geometry and setting of the LV model coordinate system. The results for three real LV angiographic image sequences are presented two with fixed multiple views using supplementary angiography and one with rotating views. 3-D reconstructions utilizing different numbers of views were compared and evaluated in terms of contours manually traced by an experienced radiologist. The performance of the preprocesses was also evaluated and the effects of variations in user-specified parameters on the final 3-D reconstruction results were shown to be sufficiently small. These experimental results demonstrate the potential usefulness of combining multiple views for 3-D recovery from real LV cineangiocardiograms,"['medical diagnostic imaging', 'time-varying 3-D left-ventricular shape reconstruction', 'multiview X-ray cineangiocardiograms', 'clinical cardiology', 'two-dimensional occluding contours', 'arterial septal defect', 'B-spline', 'computational costs', 'user-interactive systems', 'angiographic image sequences', 'fixed multiple views', 'experienced radiologist', 'user-specified parameters variations', 'angiocardiography', 'calibration', 'image reconstruction', 'image sequences', 'medical image processing', 'shape measurement']",215,19
1518,1703,Statistical analysis of nonlinearly reconstructed near-infrared tomographic images. II. Experimental interpretation For pt. I see ibid. vol. 21 no. 7 p. 755-63 2002). Image error analysis of a diffuse near-infrared tomography NIR system has been carried out on simulated data using a statistical approach described in pt. I of this paper Pogue et al. 2002). The methodology is used here with experimental data acquired on phantoms with a prototype imaging system intended for characterizing breast tissue. Results show that imaging performance is not limited by random measurement error but rather by calibration issues. The image error over the entire field of view is generally not minimized when an accurate homogeneous estimate of the phantom properties is available however local image error over a target region of interest ROI is reduced. The image reconstruction process which includes a Levenberg-Marquardt style regularization provides good minimization of the objective function yet its reduction is not always correlated with an overall image error decrease. Minimization of the bias in an ROI which contains localized changes in the optical properties can be achieved through five to nine iterations of the algorithm.

1519,1704,Statistical analysis of nonlinearly reconstructed near-infrared tomographic images. I. Theory and simulations Near-infrared NIR diffuse tomography is an emerging method for imaging the interior of tissues to quantify concentrations of hemoglobin and exogenous chromophores noninvasively in vivo. It often exploits an optical diffusion model-based image reconstruction algorithm to estimate spatial property values from measurements of the light flux at the surface of the tissue. In this study mean-squared error MSE over the image is used to evaluate methods for regularizing the ill-posed inverse image reconstruction problem in NIR tomography. Estimates of image bias and image standard deviation were calculated based upon 100 repeated reconstructions of a test image with randomly distributed noise added to the light flux measurements. It was observed that the bias error dominates at high regularization parameter values while variance dominates as the algorithm is allowed to approach the optimal solution. This optimum does not necessarily correspond to the minimum projection error solution but typically requires further iteration with a decreasing regularization parameter to reach the lowest image error. Increasing measurement noise causes a need to constrain the minimum regularization parameter to higher values in order to achieve a minimum in the overall image MSE,"['medical diagnostic imaging', 'hemoglobin', 'oxygen saturation', 'photon migration', 'optical diffusion model-based image reconstruction algorithm', 'decreasing regularization parameter', 'lowest image error', 'minimum regularization parameter constraint', 'bias error', 'optimal solution', 'light flux', 'mean-squared error', 'ill-posed inverse image reconstruction problem regularization', 'spatial property values estimation', 'test image', 'randomly distributed noise', 'O/sub 2/', 'image reconstruction', 'infrared imaging', 'inverse problems', 'iterative methods', 'medical image processing', 'optical tomography', 'statistical analysis']",198,24
1520,1705,The use of visual search for knowledge gathering in image decision support This paper presents a new method of knowledge gathering for decision support in image understanding based on information extracted from the dynamics of saccadic eye movements. The framework involves the construction of a generic image feature extraction library from which the feature extractors that are most relevant to the visual assessment by domain experts are determined automatically through factor analysis. The dynamics of the visual search are analyzed by using the Markov model for providing training information to novices on how and where to look for image features. The validity of the framework has been evaluated in a clinical scenario whereby the pulmonary vascular distribution on Computed Tomography images was assessed by experienced radiologists as a potential indicator of heart failure. The performance of the system has been demonstrated by training four novices to follow the visual assessment behavior of two experienced observers. In all cases the accuracy of the students improved from near random decision making 33 to accuracies ranging from 50 to 68,"['pulmonary vascular distribution', 'experienced radiologists', 'heart failure indicator', 'visual assessment behavior', 'experienced observers', 'student accuracy', 'Markov model', 'training information', 'image features', 'domain experts', 'saccadic eye movements dynamics', 'near random decision making', 'medical diagnostic imaging', 'biomechanics', 'cardiology', 'computerised tomography', 'decision support systems', 'eye', 'feature extraction', 'lung', 'Markov processes', 'medical image processing', 'visual perception']",177,23
1521,1706,Quantitative analysis of reconstructed 3-D coronary arterial tree and intracoronary devices Traditional quantitative coronary angiography is performed on two-dimensional 2-D projection views. These views are chosen by the angiographer to minimize vessel overlap and foreshortening. With 2-D projection views that are acquired in this nonstandardized fashion however there is no way to know or estimate how much error occurs in the QCA process. Furthermore coronary arteries possess a curvilinear shape and undergo a cyclical deformation due to their attachment to the myocardium. Therefore it is necessary to obtain three-dimensional 3-D information to best describe and quantify the dynamic curvilinear nature of the human coronary artery. Using a patient-specific 3-D coronary reconstruction algorithm and routine angiographic images a new technique is proposed to describe 1 the curvilinear nature of 3-D coronary arteries and intracoronary devices 2 the magnitude of the arterial deformation caused by intracoronary devices and due to heart motion and 3 optimal view(s with respect to the desired pathway for delivering intracoronary devices,"['medical diagnostic imaging', 'cyclical deformation', 'myocardium', 'dynamic curvilinear nature quantification', 'patient-specific 3-D coronary reconstruction algorithm', 'routine angiographic images', 'arterial deformation magnitude', 'intracoronary devices delivery pathway', 'human coronary artery', 'angiocardiography', 'image reconstruction', 'medical image processing', 'prosthetics']",164,13
1522,1707,Tactical airborne reconnaissance goes dual-band and beyond Multispectral imaging technologies are satisfying the need for a persistent look at the battlefield. We highlight the need to persistently monitor a battlefield to determine exactly who and what is there. For example infrared imaging can be used to expose the fuel status of an aircraft on the runway. A daytime visible-spectrum image of the same aircraft would offer information about external details such as the plane's markings and paint scheme. A dual-band camera enables precision image registration by fusion and frequently yields more information than is possible by evaluating the images separately,"['tactical airborne reconnaissance', 'multispectral imaging technologies', 'battlefield', 'infrared imaging', 'fuel status', 'aircraft', 'daytime visible-spectrum image', 'dual-band camera', 'precision image registration', 'sensor fusion', 'image registration', 'image sensors', 'infrared imaging', 'military equipment', 'remote sensing', 'sensor fusion']",100,16

1525,1710,VONNA(HBP a multimedia learning package on hotel budget planning In this paper a new learning package VONNA(HBP which provides an interactive and online environment for novices to study and practice hotel budget planning is introduced. Its design philosophy will be discussed thoughtfully with special focus on how to make use of the multimedia and Internet. According to literatures learning packages are faced to be more effective in delivering teaching material. Researchers indicate that students using a self-paced learning package score higher than in a traditional classroom setting. Moreover the learning package provides different scenarios for students to explore themselves in a practical environment and is more cost effective and systematic than lectures. Currently most learning packages in hotel education are not implemented using multimedia with Internet access. Our paper describes a new learning package that fills the gaps. VONNA(HBP requires participants to investigate operational budgets on various areas such as sales levels payroll inventory level promotion strategies and facilities planning etc. Eventually the students/novices are required to practice their skills in a comprehensive case about a hypothetical hotel. They need to solve managerial problems by a combination of budgetary planning on human resources staff training programmes facilities maintenance and replacement or promotion schemes.

It is an area that arguably presents the greatest challenges in adaptation to contemporary learning technologies but at the same time stands to benefit most from the potential of the Web. This paper addresses the design and development of a CD-ROM learning resource for food and beverage. It is a learning resource which is designed to integrate with rather than to replace existing conventional classroom and laboratory learning methods and thus compensate for the decline in the resource base faced in food and beverage education in recent years.

1527,1712,Eliminating counterevidence with applications to accountable certificate management This paper presents a method to increase the accountability of certificate management by making it intractable for the certification authority CA to create contradictory statements about the validity of a certificate. The core of the method is a new primitive undeniable attester that allows someone to commit to some set S of bitstrings by publishing a short digest of S and to give attestations for any x that it is or is not a member of S. Such an attestation can be verified by obtaining in an authenticated way the published digest and applying a verification algorithm to the triple of the bitstring the attestation and the digest. The most important feature of this primitive is the intractability of creating two contradictory proofs for the same candidate element x and digest. We give an efficient construction for undeniable attesters based on authenticated search trees. We show that the construction also applies to sets of more structured elements. We also show that undeniable attesters exist iff collision-resistant hash functions exist,"['counterevidence elimination', 'accountable certificate management', 'accountability', 'certification authority', 'undeniable attester primitive', 'attestations', 'published digest', 'verification algorithm', 'bitstring', 'contradictory proofs', 'authenticated search trees', 'structured elements', 'collision-resistant hash functions', 'long-term authenticity', 'non repudiation', 'public-key infrastructure', 'time-stamping', 'certification', 'message authentication', 'public key cryptography', 'tree searching']",177,21
1528,1713,A uniform framework for regulating service access and information release on the Web The widespread use of Internet-based services is increasing the amount of information such as user profiles that clients are required to disclose. This information demand is necessary for regulating access to services and functionally convenient e.g. to support service customization but it has raised privacy-related concerns which if not addressed may affect the users disposition to use network services. At the same time servers need to regulate service access without disclosing entirely the details of their access control policy. There is therefore a pressing need for privacy-aware techniques to regulate access to services open to the network. We propose an approach for regulating service access and information disclosure on the Web. The approach consists of a uniform formal framework to formulate  and reason about  both service access and information disclosure constraints. It also provides a means for parties to communicate their requirements while ensuring that no private information be disclosed and that the communicated requirements are correct with respect to the constraints,"['service access regulation', 'information release', 'WWW', 'Internet', 'user profiles', 'information demand', 'client server systems', 'access control policy', 'privacy-aware techniques', 'network services', 'information disclosure', 'uniform formal framework', 'reasoning', 'authorisation', 'client-server systems', 'data privacy', 'information resources']",175,17
1529,1714,Hordes a multicast based protocol for anonymity With widespread acceptance of the Internet as a public medium for communication and information retrieval there has been rising concern that the personal privacy of users can be eroded by cooperating network entities. A technical solution to maintaining privacy is to provide anonymity. We present a protocol for initiator anonymity called Hordes which uses forwarding mechanisms similar to those used in previous protocols for sending data but is the first protocol to make use of multicast routing to anonymously receive data. We show this results in shorter transmission latencies and requires less work of the protocol participants in terms of the messages processed. We also present a comparison of the security and anonymity of Hordes with previous protocols using the first quantitative definition of anonymity and unlinkability. Our analysis shows that Hordes provides anonymity in a degree similar to that of Crowds and Onion Routing but also that Hordes has numerous performance advantages,"['Hordes', 'protocol', 'Internet', 'personal privacy', 'cooperating network entities', 'initiator anonymity', 'forwarding mechanisms', 'multicast routing', 'transmission latencies', 'unlinkability', 'Crowds', 'Onion Routing', 'performance', 'data privacy', 'Internet', 'multicast communication', 'protocols', 'telecommunication network routing']",160,18

1545,1733,Computing grid unlocks research Under the UK government's spending review in 2000 the Office of Science and Technology was allocated Pounds 98m to establish a three year e-science research and development programme. The programme has a bold vision to change the dynamic of the way science is undertaken. The term e-science was introduced by John Taylor director general of research councils in the Office of Science and Technology. He saw many areas of science becoming increasingly reliant on new ways of collaborative multidisciplinary interorganisation working. E-science is intended to capture these new modes of working. There are two major components to the programme the science and the infrastructure to support that science. The infrastructure is generally referred to as the Grid.

Since no convexity assumptions are made on the data the problem is reformulated in relaxed form. The relaxed state equation is discretized by the implicit trapezoidal scheme and the relaxed controls are approximated by piecewise constant relaxed controls. We then propose a combined descent and discretization method that generates sequences of discrete relaxed controls and progressively refines the discretization. Since here the adjoint of the discrete state equation is not defined we use at each iteration an approximate derivative of the cost functional defined by discretizing the continuous adjoint equation and the integral involved by appropriate trapezoidal schemes. It is proved that accumulation points of sequences constructed by this method satisfy the strong relaxed necessary conditions for optimality for the continuous problem. Finally the computed relaxed controls can be easily approximated by piecewise constant classical controls,"['approximate relaxed descent method', 'optimal control problems', 'ordinary differential equations', 'relaxed state equation discretization', 'implicit trapezoidal scheme', 'piecewise constant relaxed controls', 'relaxed control approximation', 'discrete relaxed control sequences', 'discretization refinement', 'discrete state equation', 'cost functional approximate derivative', 'trapezoidal schemes', 'differential equations', 'gradient index optics', 'optimal control', 'piecewise constant techniques']",160,16

Numerical studies are conducted on a five-layer piezoelectric plate and the complexity of stresses and deformations under combined loading is illustrated.

Namely only the properties of the constituent fiber and matrix materials of the composites are required as input data. In the previous part lamina theory was presented. Three fundamental quantities of the laminae i.e. the internal stresses generated in the constituent fiber and matrix materials and the instantaneous compliance matrix with different fiber preform including woven braided and knitted fabric reinforcements were explicitly obtained by virtue of the bridging micromechanics model. In this paper the laminate stress analysis is shown. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the load shared by each lamina in the laminate so that the lamina theory can be applied. Incorporation of the constitutive equations into an FEM software package is illustrated. A number of application examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the constitutive theory. The predictions made include failure envelopes of multidirectional laminates subjected to biaxial in-plane loads thermomechanical cycling stress-strain curves of a titanium metal matrix composite laminate S-N curves of multilayer knitted fabric reinforced laminates under tensile fatigue and bending load-deflection plots and ultimate bending strengths of laminated braided fabric reinforced beams subjected to lateral loads,"['general constitutive description', 'inelastic behavior', 'failure behavior', 'fibrous laminates', 'laminate theory', 'strength behavior', 'composites', 'fiber preforms', 'micromechanics', 'layer-by-layer analysis', 'internal stresses', 'matrix materials', 'instantaneous compliance matrix', 'stress analysis', 'load', 'FEM software package', 'failure envelopes', 'multidirectional laminates', 'biaxial in-plane loads', 'thermomechanical cycling stress-strain curves', 'titanium metal matrix composite laminate', 'S-N curves', 'multilayer knitted fabric reinforced laminates', 'tensile fatigue', 'bending load deflection plots', 'ultimate bending strengths', 'laminated braided fabric reinforced beams', 'lateral loads', 'bending', 'bending strength', 'fatigue', 'fibre reinforced composites', 'finite element analysis', 'internal stresses', 'laminates', 'mechanical engineering computing', 'stress analysis', 'stress-strain relations', 'thermomechanical treatment']",243,39
1560,1748,On a general constitutive description for the inelastic and failure behavior of fibrous laminates. I. Lamina theory It is well known that a structural design with isotropic materials can only be accomplished based on a stress failure criterion. This is however generally not true with laminated composites. Only when the laminate is subjected to an in-plane load can the ultimate failure of the laminate correspond to its last-ply failure and hence a stress failure criterion may be sufficient to detect the maximum load that can be sustained by the laminate. Even in such a case the load shared by each lamina in the laminate cannot be correctly determined if the lamina instantaneous stiffness matrix is inaccurately provided since the lamina is always statically indeterminate in the laminate. If however the laminate is subjected to a lateral load its ultimate failure occurs before last-ply failure and use of the stress failure criterion is no longer sufficient an additional critical deflection or curvature condition must also be employed. This necessitates development of an efficient constitutive relationship for laminated composites in order that the laminate strains/deflections up to ultimate failure can be accurately calculated. A general constitutive description for the thermomechanical response of a fibrous laminate up to ultimate failure with applications to various fibrous laminates is presented in the two papers. The constitutive relationship is obtained by combining classical lamination theory with a recently developed bridging micromechanics model through a layer-by-layer analysis.

1561,1749,Advanced aerostatic stability analysis of cable-stayed bridges using finite-element method Based on the concept of limit point instability an advanced nonlinear finite-element method that can be used to analyze the aerostatic stability of cable-stayed bridges is proposed. Both geometric nonlinearity and three components of wind loads are considered in this method. The example bridge is the second Santou Bay cable-stayed bridge with a main span length of 518 m built in China. Aerostatic stability of the example bridge is investigated using linear and proposed methods. The effect of pitch moment coefficient on the aerostatic stability of the bridge has been studied. The results show that the aerostatic instability analyses of cable-stayed bridges based on the linear method considerably overestimate the wind-resisting capacity of cable-stayed bridges. The proposed method is highly accurate and efficient. Pitch moment coefficient has a major effect on the aerostatic stability of cable-stayed bridges. Finally the aerostatic failure mechanism of cable-stayed bridges is explained by tracing the aerostatic instability path,"['limit point instability', 'advanced nonlinear finite element method', 'advanced aerostatic stability analysis', 'cable-stayed bridges', 'geometric nonlinearity', 'wind loads', 'Santou Bay cable-stayed bridge', 'China', 'pitch moment coefficient', 'aerostatic failure mechanism', 'civil engineering computing', 'finite element analysis', 'mechanical stability', 'wind']",163,14
1562,1750,A dynamic method for weighted linear least squares problems A new method for solving the weighted linear least squares problems with full rank is proposed. Based on the theory of Liapunov's stability the method associates a dynamic system with a weighted linear least squares problem whose solution we are interested in and integrates the former numerically by an A-stable numerical method. The numerical tests suggest that the new method is more than comparative with current conventional techniques based on the normal equations,"['dynamic method', 'weighted linear least squares problems', 'Lyapunov stability', 'A-stable numerical method', 'eigenvalues and eigenfunctions', 'least squares approximations', 'Lyapunov methods']",82,7
1563,1751,An adaptive time step procedure for a parabolic problem with blow-up In this paper we introduce and analyze a fully discrete approximation for a parabolic problem with a nonlinear boundary condition which implies that the solutions blow up in finite time. We use standard linear elements with mass lumping for the space variable. For the time discretization we write the problem in an equivalent form which is obtained by introducing an appropriate time re-scaling and then we use explicit Runge-Kutta methods for this equivalent problem. In order to motivate our procedure we present it first in the case of a simple ordinary differential equation and show how the blow up time is approximated in this case. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the blowup of the numerical solution and prove that the numerical blow-up time converges to the continuous one. We also study for the explicit Euler approximation the localization of blow-up points for the numerical scheme,"['adaptive time step procedure', 'parabolic problem', 'fully discrete approximation', 'nonlinear boundary condition', 'standard linear elements', 'Runge-Kutta methods', 'explicit Euler approximation', 'approximation theory', 'polynomials', 'Runge-Kutta methods', 'stability']",158,11

As a basic new feature. our approach allows to use different finite element discretisations on each level of the multi-grid hierarchy. Thus in our multi-level approach accurate higher order finite element discretisations can be combined with fast multi-level solvers based on lower order nonconforming finite element discretisations.

1575,1763,Numerical studies of 2D free surface waves with fixed bottom The motion of surface waves under the effect of bottom is a very interesting and challenging phenomenon in the nature. we use boundary integral method to compute and analyze this problem. In the linear analysis the linearized equations have bounded error increase under some compatible conditions. This contributes to the cancellation of instable Kelvin-Helmholtz terms. Under the effect of bottom the existence of equations is hard to determine but given some limitations it proves true. These limitations are that the swing of interfaces should be small enough and the distance between surface and bottom should be large enough. In order to maintain the stability of computation some compatible relationship must be satisfied. In the numerical examples the simulation of standing waves and breaking waves are calculated. And in the case of shallow bottom we found that the behavior of waves are rather singular,"['numerical studies', '2D free surface waves', 'boundary integral method', 'linear analysis', 'linearized equations', 'instable Kelvin-Helmholtz terms', 'boundary integral equations', 'extrapolation']",153,8

Artificial intelligence AI studies these three aspects in artificial systems. Briefly we could say that knowledge refers to the system's world model and reasoning to the manipulation of this knowledge. Learning is slightly more complex the system interacts with the world and as a consequence it builds onto and modifies its knowledge. This process of self-building and self-modifying is known as learning. This thesis is set within the field of artificial intelligence and focuses on learning.

1589,1777,Midlife career choices how are they different from other career choices It was 1963 when Candy Start began working in libraries. Libraries seemed to be a refuge from change a dependable environment devoted primarily to preservation. She was mistaken. Technological changes in every decade of her experience have affected how and where she used her MLS. Far from a static refuge libraries have proven to be spaceships loaded with precious cargo hurtling into the unknown. The historian in the author says that perhaps libraries have always been like this. This paper looks at a midlife decision point and the choice that this librarian made to move from a point of lessening productivity and interest to one of increasing challenge and contribution.

The challenges faced by librarians considering the move from academic to public librarianship can be equally and significantly demanding. To most outsiders at least on the surface it may appear to be a quick and easy transition to make but some professional librarians recognize the distinct differences between these areas of librarianship. Although the ubiquitous nature of technology has brought the various work responsibilities of academic and public librarians closer together during the last decade there remain key differences in job-related duties and the work environments.

Issues examined include professional education and training initial career-planning and placement continuing education scouting and mentoring job market conditions work experience and personal skills professional involvement and professional association self-interest. This examination leads to five observations 1. It is easier in terms of career transitions for a librarian to become an archivist than it is for an archivist to become a librarian 2. The progression from a small college venue to a large research university is very manageable with the proper planning and experience 3. At least three of the career elements-professional education career-planning and professional association self-interest-in their best moments provide a foundation that enables a future consideration of change between institutional types and professional areas and in their worst moments conspire against the midcareer professional in terms of change 4.

1597,1785,The effect of a male-oriented computer gaming culture on careers in the computer industry If careers in the computer industry were viewed it would be evident that there is a conspicuous gender gap between the number of male and female employees. The same gap can be observed at the college level where males are dominating females as to those who pursue and obtain a degree in computer science. The question that this research paper intends to show is why are males so dominant when it comes to computer related matters The author has traced this question back to the computer game. Computer games are a fun medium and provide the means for an individual to become computer literate through the engagement of spatial learning and cognitive processing abilities. Since such games are marketed almost exclusively to males females have a distinct disadvantage. Males are more computer literate through the playing of computer games and are provided with an easy lead-in to more advanced utilization of computers such as programming. Females tend to be turned off due to the male stereotypes and marketing associated with games and thus begins the gender gap,"['careers', 'computer industry', 'gender gap', 'computer science degree', 'computer games', 'computer literacy', 'female employees', 'spatial learning', 'cognitive processing', 'male stereotypes', 'marketing', 'computer games', 'computer literacy', 'DP industry', 'gender issues', 'personnel']",191,16
1598,1786,A humane tool for aiding computer science advisors computer science students and parents Over the past few years the computer science department faculty at Baylor has observed that some students who perform adequately during the freshman and sophomore years have substantial difficulty during the junior and senior years of study. Baylor University is an institution committed to being caring of its students. The objective for this study grew out of these two realities. There are three objectives of this research. One objective is to identify students no later than the sophomore year who are less likely to succeed as computer science majors. A second objective is to accomplish this identification by using data from seniors majoring in computer science. A third objective is to begin to use this information at the end of their sophomore year when meeting with a computer science faculty advisor. A regression study is conducted on the data from all students classified as seniors majoring in computer science in May 2001 showing grades in six freshman and sophomore courses and showing grades for at least five junior or senior level computer science courses. These students and their course performance data constituted the study sample,"['humane tool', 'computer science advisors', 'computer science students', 'parents', 'Baylor University', 'student care', 'sophomore year', 'computer science majors', 'regression study', 'course performance data', 'computer science education', 'statistical analysis', 'teaching']",198,13
1599,1787,The theory of information reversal The end of the industrial age coincides with the advent of the information society as the next model of social and economic organization which brings about significant changes in the way modern man conceives work and the social environment. The functional basis of the new model is pivoted upon the effort to formulate the theory on the violent reversal of the basic relationship between man and information and isolate it as one of the components for the creation of the new electronic reality. The objective of the theory of reversal is to effectively contribute to the formulation of a new definition consideration in regards to the concept of the emerging information society. In order to empirically apply the theory of reversal we examine a case study based on the example of the digital library,"['information reversal theory', 'information society', 'industrial age', 'social organization', 'economic organization', 'case study', 'digital library', 'information systems', 'digital libraries', 'information systems', 'social aspects of automation']",139,11

Requirements for Web transaction security WTS include strong authentication of a user non-repudiation and encryption of all traffic. In this paper we present an effective mechanism involving two different channels which addresses the prime concerns involved in the security of electronic commerce transactions ECT viz. user authentication and non-repudiation.

1605,1793,The paradigm of viral communication The IIW Institute of Information Management www.IIW.de is dealing with commercial applications of digital technologies such as the Internet digital printing and many more. A study which has been carried out by the institute identifies viral messages as a new paradigm of communication mostly found in the area of Direct Marketing and  who wonders  mainly within the USA. Viral messages underlie certain principles 1 prospects and customers of the idea are offered a technology platform providing a possibility to send a message to a majority of persons 2 there is an emotional or pecuniary incentive to participate. Ideally niches of needs and market vacua are filled with funny ideas 3 also the recipients are facing emotional or pecuniary incentives to contact a majority of further recipients  this induces a snowball effect and the message is spread virally and 4 the customer is activated as an ambassador of the piece of information for instance promoting a product or a company.

1606,1794,Well-posed anisotropic diffusion for image denoising A nonlinear iterative smoothing filter based on a second-order partial differential equation is introduced. It smooths out the image according to an anisotropic diffusion process. The approach is based on a smooth approximation of the total variation TV functional which overcomes the non-differentiability of the TV functional at the origin. In particular the authors perform linear smoothing over smooth areas but selective smoothing over candidate edges. By relating the smoothing parameter to the time step they arrive at a CFL condition which guarantees the causality of the discrete scheme. This allows the adoption of higher time discretisation steps while ensuring the absence of artefacts deriving from the non-smooth behaviour of the TV functional at the origin. In particular it is shown that the proposed approach avoids the typical staircase effects in smooth areas which occur in the standard time-marching TV scheme,"['image denoising', 'well-posed anisotropic diffusion', 'nonlinear iterative smoothing filter', 'second-order partial differential equation', 'total variation functional', 'linear smoothing', 'selective smoothing', 'CFL condition', 'discrete scheme', 'causality', 'higher time discretisation steps', 'image restoration problem', 'random Gaussian noise', 'causality', 'filtering theory', 'functional analysis', 'Gaussian noise', 'image restoration', 'iterative methods', 'nonlinear filters', 'partial differential equations', 'smoothing methods']",147,22
1607,1795,New voice over Internet protocol technique with hierarchical data security protection The authors propose a voice over Internet protocol VoIP technique with a new hierarchical data security protection HDSP scheme. The proposed HDSP scheme can maintain the voice quality degraded from packet loss and preserve high data security. It performs both the data inter-leaving on the inter-frame of voice for achieving better error recovery of voices suffering from continuous packet loss and the data encryption on the intra-frame of voice for achieving high data security which are controlled by a random bit-string sequence generated from a chaotic system. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed HDSP scheme we have successfully verified and analysed the proposed approach through software simulation and statistical measures on several test voices,"['voice over Internet protocol', 'hierarchical data security protection', 'VoIP', 'HDSP scheme', 'packet loss', 'high data security', 'data interleaving', 'data encryption', 'random bit-string sequence', 'chaotic system', 'software simulation', 'statistical measures', 'packet voice communications', 'cryptography', 'Internet telephony', 'protocols', 'security of data']",126,17

Explicit formulas are presented for one of the possible sets of coefficients for an arbitrary order by extending the previously presented 1-D approximations.

1609,1797,Use of periodic and monotonic activation functions in multilayer feedforward neural networks trained by extended Kalman filter algorithm The authors investigate the convergence and pruning performance of multilayer feedforward neural networks with different types of neuronal activation functions in solving various problems. Three types of activation functions are adopted in the network namely the traditional sigmoid function the sinusoidal function and a periodic function that can be considered as a combination of the first two functions. To speed up the learning as well as to reduce the network size the extended Kalman filter EKF algorithm conjunct with a pruning method is used to train the network. The corresponding networks are applied to solve five typical problems namely 4-point XOR logic function parity generation handwritten digit recognition piecewise linear function approximation and sunspot series prediction. Simulation results show that periodic activation functions perform better than monotonic ones in solving multicluster classification problems. Moreover the combined periodic activation function is found to possess the fast convergence and multicluster classification capabilities of the sinusoidal activation function while keeping the robustness property of the sigmoid function required in the modelling of unknown systems,"['multilayer feedforward neural networks', 'extended Kalman filter algorithm', 'monotonic activation functions', 'periodic activation functions', 'convergence', 'pruning performance', 'neuronal activation functions', 'sigmoid function', 'sinusoidal function', 'EKF algorithm', '4-point XOR logic function', 'parity generation', 'handwritten digit recognition', 'piecewise linear function approximation', 'sunspot series prediction', 'multicluster classification problems', 'convergence', 'feedforward neural nets', 'handwritten character recognition', 'Kalman filters', 'learning (artificial intelligence)', 'pattern classification', 'piecewise linear techniques', 'transfer functions']",189,24
1610,1798,Robustness evaluation of a minimal RBF neural network for nonlinear-data-storage-channel equalisation The authors present a performance-robustness evaluation of the recently developed minimal resource allocation network MRAN for equalisation in highly nonlinear magnetic recording channels in disc storage systems. Unlike communication systems equalisation of signals in these channels is a difficult problem as they are corrupted by data-dependent noise and highly nonlinear distortions. Nair and Moon 1997 have proposed a maximum signal to distortion ratio MSDR equaliser for data storage channels which uses a specially designed neural network where all the parameters of the neural network are determined theoretically based on the exact knowledge of the channel model parameters. In the present paper the performance of the MSDR equaliser is compared with that of the MRAN equaliser using a magnetic recording channel model under Conditions that include variations in partial erasure jitter width and noise power as well as model mismatch. Results from the study indicate that the less complex MRAN equaliser gives consistently better performance robustness than the MSDR equaliser in terms of signal to distortion ratios SDRs,"['robustness evaluation', 'minimal resource allocation network', 'highly nonlinear magnetic recording channels', 'disc storage systems', 'nonlinear-data-storage-channel equalisation', 'data-dependent noise', 'highly nonlinear distortions', 'maximum signal to distortion ratio equaliser', 'RBF neural network', 'MRAN equaliser', 'MSDR equaliser', 'digital magnetic recording', 'jitter noise', 'digital magnetic recording', 'equalisers', 'magnetic disc storage', 'magnetic recording noise', 'radial basis function networks']",178,18

1613,1801,Least load dispatching algorithm for parallel Web server nodes A least load dispatching algorithm for distributing requests to parallel Web server nodes is described. In this algorithm the load offered to a node by a request is estimated based on the expected transfer time of the corresponding reply through the Internet. This loading information is then used by the algorithm to identify the least load node of the Web site. By using this algorithm each request will always be sent for service at the earliest possible time. Performance comparison using NASA and ClarkNet access logs between the proposed algorithm and commonly used dispatching algorithms is performed. The results show that the proposed algorithm gives 10 higher throughput than that of the commonly used random and round-robin dispatching algorithms,"['least load dispatching algorithm', 'parallel Web server nodes', 'Internet', 'transfer time', 'NASA access logs', 'ClarkNet access logs', 'throughput', 'round-robin dispatching algorithms', 'random dispatching algorithms', 'World Wide Web server', 'client-server systems', 'file servers', 'Internet']",128,13
1614,1802,Novel TCP congestion control scheme and its performance evaluation A novel self-tuning proportional and derivative ST-PD control based TCP congestion control scheme is proposed. The new scheme approaches the congestion control problem from a control-theoretical perspective and overcomes several Important limitations associated with existing TCP congestion control schemes which are heuristic based. In the proposed scheme a PD controller is employed to keep the buffer occupancy of the bottleneck node on the connection path at an ideal operating level and it adjusts the TCP window accordingly. The control gains of the PD controller are tuned online by a fuzzy logic controller based on the perceived bandwidth-delay product of the TCP connection. This scheme gives ST-PD TCP several advantages over current TCP implementations. These include rapid response to bandwidth variations insensitivity to buffer sizes and significant improvement of TCP throughput over lossy links by decoupling congestion control and error control functions of TCP,"['TCP congestion control scheme', 'performance evaluation', 'self-tuning proportional-derivative control', 'control-theoretical perspective', 'PD controller', 'buffer occupancy', 'bottleneck node', 'connection path', 'fuzzy logic controller', 'bandwidth-delay product', 'lossy links', 'fuzzy control', 'performance evaluation', 'telecommunication congestion control', 'transport protocols', 'tuning', 'two-term control']",152,17
1615,1803,Linear complexity of polyphase power residue sequences The well known family of binary Legendre or quadratic residue sequences can be generalised to the multiple-valued case by employing a polyphase representation. These p-phase sequences with p prime also have prime length L and can be constructed from the index sequence of length L or equivalently from the cosets of pth power residues and non-residues modulo-L. The linear complexity of these polyphase sequences is derived and shown to fall into four classes depending on the value assigned to b/sub 0 the initial digit of the sequence and on whether p belongs to the set of pth power residues or not. The characteristic polynomials of the linear feedback shift registers that generate these sequences are also derived,"['linear complexity', 'polyphase power residue sequences', 'binary Legendre sequences', 'quadratic residue sequences', 'multiple-valued case', 'p-phase sequences', 'polynomials', 'linear feedback shift registers', 'cryptographic applications', 'key stream ciphers', 'binary sequences', 'binary sequences', 'computational complexity', 'cryptography', 'polynomials']",124,15
1616,1804,Module placement with boundary constraints using B*-trees The module placement problem is to determine the co-ordinates of logic modules in a chip such that no two modules overlap and some cost e.g. silicon area interconnection length etc. is optimised. To shorten connections between inputs and outputs and/or make related modules adjacent it is desired to place some modules along the specific boundaries of a chip. To deal with such boundary constraints we explore the feasibility conditions of a B*-tree with boundary constraints and develop a simulated annealing-based algorithm using B*-trees. Unlike most previous work the proposed algorithm guarantees a feasible B*-tree with boundary constraints for each perturbation. Experimental results show that the algorithm can obtain a smaller silicon area than the most recent work based on sequence pairs,"['logic module placement', 'boundary constraints', 'B*-tree', 'simulated annealing algorithm', 'silicon area', 'interconnection length', 'logic CAD', 'modules', 'simulated annealing', 'trees (mathematics)']",128,10
1617,1805,Exact analytical model for the AEP of control signals An exact analytical model for the aliasing error probability AEP in the signature analysis of control signals using a modified signature analyser is presented. The signature analyser used comprises a general-structure two-input compacting module TICM which simplifies the motherboard VLSI design by providing a flexible geometry which could be easily integrated with neighbouring structures. The use of the modified data probe eliminates the ambiguity introduced by the high-impedance state and at the same time retains the same signature of the binary stream. The model specifies algebraically the effects of the TICM architecture the test pattern length and the control stream error probabilities. It is proved that the hardware criterion used for calculating the AEP for the internal and external exclusive-OR two-input shift registers is not valid for the general case and a new criterion is provided.

1622,1810,Input-output based pole-placement controller for a class of time-delay systems A controller structure valid for SISO plants involving both internal and external point delays is presented. The control signal is based only on the input and output plant signals. The controller allows finite or infinite spectrum assignment. The most important feature of the proposed controller is that it only involves the use of a class of point-delayed signals. Thus the controller synthesis involves less computational cost than former methods.

1623,1811,Adaptive tracking controller design for robotic systems using Gaussian wavelet networks An adaptive tracking control design for robotic systems using Gaussian wavelet networks is proposed. A Gaussian wavelet network with accurate approximation capability is employed to approximate the unknown dynamics of robotic systems by using an adaptive learning algorithm that can learn the parameters of the dilation and translation of Gaussian wavelet functions. Depending on the finite number of wavelet basis functions which result in inevitable approximation errors a robust control law is provided to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop robotic system that can be proved by Lyapunov theory.

1624,1812,Computing the frequency response of systems affinely depending on uncertain parameters The computation of the frequency response of systems depending affinely on uncertain parameters can be reduced to that of all its one-dimensional edge plants while the image of such an edge plant at a fixed frequency is an arc or a line segment in the complex plane. Based on this conclusion four computational formulas of the maximal and minimal maxi-mini magnitudes and phases of an edge plant at a fixed frequency are given. The formulas besides sharing a simpler form of expression concretely display how the extrema of the frequency response of the edge plant relate to the typical characteristics of the arc and line segment such as the centre radius and tangent points of the arc the distance from the origin to the line segment etc. The direct application of the results is to compute the Bode Nichols and Nyquist-plot collections of the systems which are needed in robustness analysis and design,"['frequency response', 'uncertain parameters', 'affine systems', 'one-dimensional edge plants', 'arc', 'line segment', 'Bode-plot', 'Nichols-plot', 'Nyquist-plot', 'robustness analysis', 'robustness design', 'frequency-domain design methods', 'Bode diagrams', 'frequency response', 'frequency-domain analysis', 'frequency-domain synthesis', 'Nyquist diagrams', 'polynomials', 'robust control', 'uncertain systems']",164,20

1626,1814,Control of integral processes with dead-time. 2. Quantitative analysis For part 1 see ibid. p.285-90 2002). Several different control schemes for integral processes with dead time resulted in the same disturbance response. It has already been shown that such a response is subideal. Hence it is necessary to quantitatively analyse the achievable specifications and the robust stability regions. The control parameter can be quantitatively determined with a compromise between the disturbance response and the robustness. Four specifications normalised maximum dynamic error maximum decay rate normalised control action bound and approximate recovery time are used to characterise the step-disturbance response. It is shown that any attempt to obtain a normalised dynamic error less than tau sub m is impossible and a sufficient condition on the relative gain-uncertainty bound is square root 3)/2,"['integral processes', 'dead-time', 'quantitative analysis', 'disturbance response', 'robust stability regions', 'robustness', 'maximum dynamic error', 'maximum decay rate', 'control action bound', 'approximate recovery time', 'step-disturbance response', 'sufficient condition', 'gain-uncertainty bound', 'control system analysis', 'observers', 'robust control']",131,16

The controller can be designed to reject ramp disturbances as well as step disturbances and even arbitrary disturbances. When the plant model is available only two parameters are left to tune. One is the time constant of the set-point response and the other is the time constant of the disturbance response. The latter is tuned according to the compromise between disturbance response and robustness. This control scheme has a simple clear easy-to-design easy-to-implement structure and good performance.

1629,1817,Nonlinear adaptive control via sliding-mode state and perturbation observer The paper presents a nonlinear adaptive controller NAC for single-input single-output feedback linearisable nonlinear systems. A sliding-mode state and perturbation observer is designed to estimate the system states and perturbation which includes the combined effect of system nonlinearities uncertainties and external disturbances. The NAC design does not require the details of the nonlinear system model and full system states. It possesses an adaptation capability to deal with system parameter uncertainties unmodelled system dynamics and external disturbances. The convergence of the observer and the stability analysis of the controller/observer system are given.

The control design is based on a sliding-mode uncertainty estimator developed under a framework of algebraic-differential concepts. The closed-loop stability for the underlying closed-loop system is achieved via averaging techniques.

1631,1819,Structural interpretation of matched pole-zero discretisation Deals with matched pole-zero discretisation which has been used in practice for hand calculations in the digital redesign of continuous-time systems but available only in the transfer-function form. Since this form is inconvenient for characterising the time-domain properties of sampled-data loops and for computerising the design of such systems a state-space formulation is developed. Under the new interpretation the matched pole-zero model is shown to be structurally identical to a hold-equivalent discrete-time model where the generalised hold takes integral part thus unifying the most widely used discretisation approaches. An algorithm for obtaining the generalised hold function is presented. The hold-equivalent structure of the matched pole-zero model clarifies several discrete-time system properties such as controllability and observability and their preservation or loss with a matched pole-zero discretisation. With the proposed formulation the matched pole-zero hold-equivalent and mapping models can now all be constructed with a single schematic model,"['structural interpretation', 'matched pole-zero discretisation', 'continuous-time systems', 'time-domain properties', 'sampled-data loops', 'state-space formulation', 'hold-equivalent discrete-time model', 'controllability', 'observability', 'closed-loop system', 'digital simulations', 'closed loop systems', 'controllability', 'discrete time systems', 'observability', 'poles and zeros', 'sampled data systems']",153,17
1632,1820,Fast accurate and stable simulation of power electronic systems using virtual resistors and capacitors Simulation of power electronic circuits remains a problem due to the high level of stiffness brought about by the modelling of switches as biresistors i.e. very low turn-on resistance and very high turn-off resistance. The merits and drawbacks of two modelling methods that address this problem are discussed. A modelling solution for ensuring numerically stable accurate and fast simulation of power electronic systems is proposed. The solution enables easy connectivity between power electronic elements in the simulation model. It involves the modelling of virtual capacitance at switching nodes to soften voltage discontinuity due to the switch current suddenly going to zero. Undesirable ringing effects that may arise due to the interaction between the virtual capacitance and circuit inductance are eliminated by modelling virtual damping resistors in parallel to inductors that are adjacent to switching elements. A midpoint configuration method is also introduced for modelling shunt capacitors. A DC traction system is simulated using this modelling strategy and the results are included. Simulation results obtained using this modelling strategy are validated by comparison with the established mesh analysis technique of modelling. The simulation performance is also compared with the Power System Blockset commercial software,"['power electronic systems simulation', 'virtual resistors', 'virtual capacitors', 'turn-on resistance', 'high turn-off resistance', 'switch modelling', 'switching nodes', 'voltage discontinuity softening', 'ringing effects', 'DC traction system', 'mesh analysis technique', 'Power System Blockset software', 'computer simulation', 'capacitors', 'circuit simulation', 'power electronics', 'power engineering computing', 'resistors', 'switching circuits']",207,19

Three power switches are employed in the proposed rectifier. Two PWM control schemes are used to draw a sinusoidal line current with low current distortion. The control signals of the power switches are derived from the DC link voltage balance compensator line current controller and DC link voltage regulator. The hysteresis current control scheme is employed to track the line current command.

1636,1824,Parallel operation of capacity-limited three-phase four-wire active power filters Three-phase four-wire active power filters APFs are presented that can be paralleled to enlarge the system capacity and reliability. The APF employs the PWM four-leg voltage-source inverter. A decoupling control approach for the leg connected to the neutral line is proposed such that the switching of all legs has no interaction. Functions of the proposed APF include compensation of reactive power harmonic current unbalanced power and zero-sequence current of the load. The objective is to achieve unity power factor balanced line current and zero neutral-line current. Compensation of all components is capacity-limited co-operating with the cascaded load current sensing scheme. Multiple APFs can be paralleled to share the load power without requiring any control interconnection. In addition to providing the theoretic bases and detailed design of the APFs two 6 kVA APFs are implemented.

1637,1825,Fuzzy logic controlled shunt active power filter for power quality improvement The simulation and experimental study of a fuzzy logic controlled three-phase shunt active power filter to improve power quality by compensating harmonics and reactive power required by a nonlinear load is presented. The advantage of fuzzy control is that it is based on a linguistic description and does not require a mathematical model of the system. The fuzzy control scheme is realised on an inexpensive dedicated micro-controller INTEL 8031 based system. The compensation process is based on sensing line currents only an approach different from conventional methods which require harmonics or reactive volt-ampere requirement of the load. The performance of the fuzzy logic controller is compared with a conventional PI controller. The dynamic behavior of the fuzzy controller is found to be better than the conventional PI controller.

1638,1826,Modeling shape and topology of low-resolution density maps of biological macromolecules We develop an efficient way of representing the geometry and topology of volumetric datasets of biological structures from medium to low resolution aiming at storing and querying them in a database framework. We make use of a new vector quantization algorithm to select the points within the macromolecule that best approximate the probability density function of the original volume data. Connectivity among points is obtained with the use of the alpha shapes theory. This novel data representation has a number of interesting characteristics such as 1 it allows us to automatically segment and quantify a number of important structural features from low-resolution maps such as cavities and channels opening the possibility of querying large collections of maps on the basis of these quantitative structural features 2 it provides a compact representation in terms of size 3 it contains a subset of three-dimensional points that optimally quantify the densities of medium resolution data and 4 a general model of the geometry and topology of the macromolecule as opposite to a spatially unrelated bunch of voxels is easily obtained by the use of the alpha shapes theory,"['geometry', 'topology', 'volumetric datasets', 'biological structures', 'database framework', 'vector quantization algorithm', 'low-resolution density maps', 'biological macromolecules', 'modeling', 'probability density function', 'data representation', 'structural features', 'cavities', 'channels', 'connectivity', 'compact representation', 'three-dimensional points', 'medium resolution data', 'general model', 'original volume data', 'alpha shapes theory', 'biology computing', 'data models', 'information services', 'macromolecules', 'molecular biophysics', 'physiological models', 'probability', 'topology', 'vectors']",196,30
1639,1827,Gossip is synteny Incomplete gossip and the syntenic distance between genomes The syntenic distance between two genomes is given by the minimum number of fusions fissions and translocations required to transform one into the other ignoring the order of genes within chromosomes. Computing this distance is NP-hard. In the present work we give a tight connection between syntenic distance and the incomplete gossip problem a novel generalization of the classical gossip problem. In this problem there are n gossipers each with a unique piece of initial information they communicate by phone calls in which the two participants exchange all their information. The goal is to minimize the total number of phone calls necessary to inform each gossiper of his set of relevant gossip which he desires to learn. As an application of the connection between syntenic distance and incomplete gossip we derive an O(2/sup O(n log n algorithm to exactly compute the syntenic distance between two genomes with at most n chromosomes each. Our algorithm requires O(n/sup 2/+2/sup O(d log d time when this distance is d improving the O(n/sup 2/+2(O(d//sup 2 running time of the best previous exact algorithm,"['syntenic distance', 'genomes', 'NP-hard', 'incomplete gossip problem', 'comparative genomics', 'running time', 'chromosomes', 'algorithm theory', 'biology computing', 'cellular biophysics', 'computational complexity']",190,11
1640,1828,Exploiting structure in quantified formulas We study the computational problem find the value of the quantified formula obtained by quantifying the variables in a sum of terms. The sum can be based on any commutative monoid the quantifiers need only satisfy two simple conditions and the variables can have any finite domain. This problem is a generalization of the problem given a sum-of-products of terms find the value of the sum studied by R.E. Stearns and H.B. Hunt III 1996). A data structure called a structure tree is defined which displays information about subproblems that can be solved independently during the process of evaluating the formula. Some formulas have good structure trees which enable certain generic algorithms to evaluate the formulas in significantly less time than by brute force evaluation. By generic algorithm we mean an algorithm constructed from uninterpreted function symbols quantifier symbols and monoid operations. The algebraic nature of the model facilitates a formal treatment of local reductions based on the local replacement of terms. Such local reductions preserve formula structure in the sense that structure trees with nice properties transform into structure trees with similar properties. These local reductions can also be used to transform hierarchical specified problems with useful structure into hierarchically specified problems having similar structure,"['quantified formulas', 'structure exploitation', 'commutative monoid', 'data structure', 'structure tree', 'satisfiability problems', 'constraint satisfaction problems', 'dynamic programming', 'computational complexity', 'generic algorithms', 'function symbols', 'quantifier symbols', 'monoid operations', 'hierarchically specified problems', 'computational complexity', 'constraint theory', 'data structures', 'dynamic programming', 'genetic algorithms']",211,19
1641,1829,Improved approximation of Max-Cut on graphs of bounded degree Let alpha approximately=0.87856 denote the best approximation ratio currently known for the Max-Cut problem on general graphs. We consider a semidefinite relaxation of the Max-Cut problem round it using the random hyperplane rounding technique of M.X. Goemans and D.P. Williamson 1995 and then add a local improvement step. We show that for graphs of degree at most Delta  our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of at least alpha + epsilon  where epsilon 0 is a constant that depends only on Delta .. Using computer assisted analysis we show that for graphs of maximal degree 3 our algorithm obtains an approximation ratio of at least 0.921 and for 3-regular graphs the approximation ratio is at least 0.924.

This paper considers the problem of recognizing whether a positive function f is regular where f is given by min T(f the set of all minimal true vectors of f). We propose a simple linear time i.e. O(n|min T(f)|)-time algorithm for it. This improves upon the previous algorithm by J.S. Provan and M.O. Ball 1988 which requires O(n/sup 2/|min T(f)| time. As a corollary we also present an O(n(n+|min T(f)|))-time algorithm for the recognition problem of 2-monotonic functions,"['linear time algorithm', 'regular Boolean functions', 'monotone Boolean function', 'nonzero component', 'true vector', 'positive function', '2-monotonic functions', 'Boolean functions', 'threshold logic']",125,9
1645,1833,British Standard 7666 as a framework for geocoding land and property information the UK The article examines the role of British Standard 7666 in the development of a national framework for geocoding land and property information in the United Kingdom. The author assesses how local authorities and other agencies concerned with property and address datasets are coping with the introduction of British Standard 7666 and examines the prospects and limitations of this development. British Standard 7666 has four parts comprising specifications for street gazetteer land and property gazetteer addresses and public rights of way. The organisation coordinating the introduction of British Standard 7666 Improvement and Development Agency IDeA is also overseeing the development and maintenance of a National Land and Property Gazetteer NLPG based on British Standard 7666.

1646,1834,A formal model of correctness in a cadastre A key issue for cadastral systems is the maintenance of their correctness. Correctness is defined to be the proper correspondence between the valid legal situation and the content of the cadastre. This correspondence is generally difficult to achieve since the cadastre is not a complete representation of all aspects influencing the legal situation in reality. The goal of the paper is to develop a formal model comprising representations of the cadastre and of reality that allows the simulation and investigation of cases where this correspondence is potentially violated. For this purpose the model consists of two parts the first part represents the valid legal situation and the second part represents the cadastre. This makes it feasible to mark the differences between reality and the cadastre. The marking together with the two parts of the model facilitate the discussion of issues in real-world cadastral systems where incorrectness occurs. In order to develop a formal model the paper uses the transfer of ownership of a parcel between two persons as minimal case study. The foundation for the formalization is a modern version of the situation calculus. The focus moves from the analysis of the cadastre to the preparation of a conceptual and a formalized model and the implementation of a prototype,"['formal correctness model', 'cadastre', 'cadastral systems', 'correctness maintenance', 'legal situation', 'formal model', 'transfer of ownership', 'minimal case study', 'situation calculus', 'formalized model', 'cartography', 'formal languages', 'formal verification', 'geography', 'law administration', 'logic programming', 'town and country planning']",217,17
1647,1835,Establishing an urban digital cadastre analytical reconstruction of parcel boundaries A new method for generating a spatially accurate legally supportive and operationally efficient cadastral database of the urban cadastral reality is described. The definition and compilation of an accurate cadastral database achieving a standard deviation smaller than 0.1 m is based on an analytical reconstruction of cadastral boundaries rather than on the conventional field reconstruction process.

1649,1837,A review of methodologies used in research on cadastral development World-wide much attention has been given to cadastral development. As a consequence of experiences made during recent decades several authors have stated the need for research in the domain of cadastre and proposed methodologies to be used. The paper contributes to the acceptance of research methodologies needed for cadastral development and thereby enhances theory in the cadastral domain. The paper reviews nine publications on cadastre and identifies the methodologies used. The review focuses on the institutional social political and economic aspects of cadastral development rather than on the technical aspects. The main conclusion is that the methodologies used are largely those of the social sciences. That agrees with the notion that cadastre relates as much to people and institutions as it relates to land and that cadastral systems are shaped by social political and economic conditions as well as technology. Since the geodetic survey profession has been the keeper of the cadastre geodetic surveyors will have to deal ever more with social science matters a fact that universities will have to consider,"['cadastral development methodologies', 'cadastre', 'research methodologies', 'political aspects', 'economic aspects', 'social sciences', 'economic conditions', 'geodetic survey profession', 'geodetic surveyors', 'land registration', 'case study', 'cartography', 'geodesy', 'government data processing', 'politics', 'socio-economic effects', 'town and country planning']",182,17
1650,1838,Anticipating the further development of cadastral systems Although the paper recognises the merits of the evolution of cadastral systems towards an increased capability over time it promotes a radical introduction or overhaul of existing cadastral systems. It encourages the development of a capability to cope with some key drivers of major change. These have been identified as globalisation the advent of fully automated cadastral environments improved decentralised methods of governance and greatly improved service delivery of future cadastral systems to a wide range of users. The paper promotes the registration of title supported by government guarantee as an effective means for rapidly introducing cadastral systems to facilitate globally competitive land markets in developing countries. In developing automated environments for cadastral systems the need to completely re-engineer and redesign cadastral systems to meet basic cadastral principles and responsiveness to individual user needs is promoted. In this environment highly decentralised cadastral operations and administration combined with light regulatory control are advocated as a future governance strategy. With regard to the level of services to users an emphasis on recognising and serving the future needs of users is seen as essential. International and national professional and user organisations involved in land administration are seen as an important vehicle for developing strategies and providing evaluation to guide the over-arching development of cadastral systems around the world,"['cadastral systems development', 'globalisation', 'automated cadastral environments', 'decentralised governance', 'service delivery', 'government guarantee', 'globally competitive land markets', 'developing countries', 'automated environments', 'cadastral principles', 'user needs', 'highly decentralised cadastral operations', 'light regulatory control', 'future governance strategy', 'future user needs', 'professional organisations', 'user organisations', 'land administration', 'cartography', 'government data processing', 'management of change', 'real estate data processing', 'systems re-engineering', 'town and country planning']",222,24
1651,1839,The dynamic aspect of land administration an often-forgotten component in system design Although the establishment of a land administration system is enough of a challenge as it is the task of keeping the system up to date with developments in society is even more challenging. Initial adjudication and cadastral mapping basically record land tenure as it exists at a given moment i.e. the static situation. The paper aims to analyse the developments that might occur in a society with respect to tenure value and use of land. These developments constitute a dynamic component of land administration. As land administration systems have to serve society on a long-term basis and normally have a long-term return on investment the author recommends taking into account both the static and dynamic component when designing land administration systems,"['dynamic aspect', 'system design', 'land administration system', 'societal developments', 'adjudication', 'cadastral mapping', 'land tenure', 'static situation', 'return on investment', 'static component', 'dynamic component', 'cartography', 'socio-economic effects', 'systems analysis', 'town and country planning']",133,15

1653,1841,The XML typechecking problem When an XML document conforms to a given type e.g. a DTD or an XML schema type it is called a valid document. Checking if a given XML document is valid is called the validation problem and is typically performed by a parser hence validating parser more precisely it is performed right after parsing by the same program module. In practice however XML documents are often generated dynamically by some program checking whether all XML documents generated by the program are valid WRT a given type is called the typechecking problem. While a validation analyzes an XML document a type checker analyzes a program and the problem's difficulty is a function of the language in which that program is expressed. The XML typechecking problem has been investigated recently and the XQuery Working Group adopted some of these techniques for typechecking XQuery. All these techniques however have limitations which need to be understood and further explored and investigated. We define the XML typechecking problem and present current approaches to typechecking discussing their limitations,"['XML typechecking problem', 'XML document', 'validation', 'XQuery', 'hypermedia markup languages']",176,5

For example new business partners from around the globe can be found their offers can be compared even complex negotiations can be conducted electronically and a contract can be drawn up and fulfilled via an electronic marketplace. However sophisticated data management is required to provide such facilities. In this paper the results of a multi-national project on creating a business-to-business electronic marketplace for small and medium-sized enterprises are presented. Tools for information discovery protocol-based negotiations and monitored contract enactment are provided and based on a business data repository. The repository integrates heterogeneous business data with business communication. Specific problems such as multilingual nature data ownership and traceability of contracts and related negotiations are addressed and it is shown that the present approach provides efficient business data management for B2B EC,"['business-to-business electronic commerce', 'business data management', 'electronic marketplace', 'small and medium-sized enterprises', 'multi-national project', 'information discovery', 'protocol-based negotiations', 'monitored contract enactment', 'business data repository', 'heterogeneous business data', 'business communication', 'data ownership', 'multilingual system', 'traceability', 'business communication', 'contracts', 'electronic commerce']",148,17
1658,1846,Semantic B2B integration issues in ontology-based approaches Solving queries to support e-commerce transactions can involve retrieving and integrating information from multiple information resources. Often users don't care which resources are used to answer their query. In such situations the ideal solution would be to hide from the user the details of the resources involved in solving a particular query. An example would be providing seamless access to a set of heterogeneous electronic product catalogues. There are many problems that must be addressed before such a solution can be provided. In this paper we discuss a number of these problems indicate how we have addressed these and go on to describe the proof-of-concept demonstration system we have developed,"['e-commerce transactions', 'queries', 'information integration', 'information retrieval', 'multiple information resources', 'heterogeneous electronic product catalogues', 'ontology-based approaches', 'semantic B2B integration', 'client-server systems', 'distributed databases', 'electronic commerce', 'knowledge engineering', 'nomenclature', 'query processing']",117,14
1659,1847,Conceptual modeling and specification generation for B2B business processes based on ebXML In order to support dynamic setup of business processes among independent organizations a formal standard schema for describing the business processes is basically required. The ebXML framework provides such a specification schema called BPSS Business Process Specification Schema which is available in two standalone representations a UML version and an XML version. The former however is not intended for the direct creation of business process specifications but for defining specification elements and their relationships required for creating an ebXML-compliant business process specification. For this reason it is very important to support conceptual modeling that is well organized and directly matched with major modeling concepts. This paper deals with how to represent and manage B2B business processes using UML-compliant diagrams. The major challenge is to organize UML diagrams in a natural way that is well suited to the business process meta-model and then to transform the diagrams into an XML version. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of conceptually modeling business processes by prototyping a business process editor tool called ebDesigner,"['B2B business processes', 'ebXML', 'conceptual modeling', 'specification generation', 'formal standard schema', 'Business Process Specification Schema', 'UML-compliant diagrams', 'meta model', 'ebDesigner', 'business process editor', 'electronic commerce', 'formal specification', 'hypermedia markup languages', 'specification languages']",181,14
1660,1848,Contracting in the days of ebusiness Putting electronic business on a sound foundation-model theoretically as well as technologically-is a central challenge for research as well as commercial development. This paper concentrates on the discovery and negotiation phase of concluding an agreement based on a contract. We present a methodology for moving seamlessly from a many-to-many relationship in the discovery phase to a one-to-one relationship in the contract negotiation phase. Making the content of contracts persistent is achieved by reconstructing contract templates by means of mereologic logic of the whole-part relation). Possibly nested sub-structures of the contract template are taken as a basis for negotiation in a dialogical way. For the negotiation itself the contract templates are extended by implications logical and sequences topical,"['electronic business', 'discovery phase', 'contracting', 'many-to-many relationship', 'one-to-one relationship', 'contract negotiation phase', 'mereologic', 'contract templates', 'nested sub-structure', 'sequences', 'implications', 'contracts', 'electronic commerce']",123,13
1661,1849,An active functionality service for e-business applications Service based architectures are a powerful approach to meet the fast evolution of business rules and the corresponding software. An active functionality service that detects events and involves the appropriate business rules is a critical component of such a service-based middleware architecture. In this paper we present an active functionality service that is capable of detecting events in heterogeneous environments it uses an integral ontology-based approach for the semantic interpretation of heterogeneous events and data and provides notifications through a publish/subscribe notification mechanism.

1662,1850,The n-tier hub technology During 2001 the Enterprise Engineering Laboratory at George Mason University was contracted by the Boeing Company to develop an eHub capability for aerospace suppliers in Taiwan. In a laboratory environment the core technology was designed developed and tested and now a large first-tier aerospace supplier in Taiwan is commercializing the technology. The project objective was to provide layered network and application services for transporting XML-based business transaction flows across multi-tier heterogeneous data processing environments. This paper documents the business scenario the eHub application and the network transport mechanisms that were used to build the n-tier hub. In contrast to most eHubs this solution takes the point of view of suppliers pushing data in accordance with supplier requirements hence enhancing the probability of supplier adoption.

1663,1851,"Supporting global user profiles through trusted authorities Personalization generally refers to making a Web site more responsive to the unique and individual needs of each user. We argue that for personalization to work effectively detailed and interoperable user profiles should be globally available for authorized sites and these profiles should dynamically reflect changes in user interests. Creating user profiles from user click-stream data seems to be an effective way of generating detailed and dynamic user profiles. However a user profile generated in this way is available only on the computer where the user accesses his browser and is inaccessible when the same user works on a different computer. On the other hand integration of the Internet with telecommunication networks has made it possible for the users to connect to the Web with a variety of mobile devices as well as desktops. This requires that user profiles should be available to any desktop or mobile device on the Internet that users choose to work with. In this paper we address these problems through the concept of trusted authority"". A user agent at the client side that captures the user click stream dynamically generates a navigational history log file in Extensible Markup Language XML).

1672,1861,Technology in distance education a global perspective to alternative delivery mechanisms Technology is providing a positive impact on delivery mechanisms employed in distance education at the university level. Some institutions are incorporating distance education as a way to extend the classroom. Other institutions are investigating new delivery mechanisms which support a revised perspective on education. These latter institutions are revising their processes for interacting with students and taking a more learner centered approach to the delivery of education. This article discusses the impact of technology on the delivery mechanisms employed in distance education. A framework is proposed here which presents a description of alternative modes of generic delivery mechanisms. It is suggested that those institutions which adopt a delivery mechanism employing an asynchronous mode can gain the most benefit from technology. This approach seems to represent the only truly innovative use of technology in distance education. The approach creates a student-oriented environment while maintaining high levels of interaction both of which are factors that contribute to student satisfaction with their overall educational experience,"['distance education', 'educational technology', 'university education', 'learner centered approach', 'student satisfaction', 'global perspective', 'asynchronous mode', 'distance learning', 'educational technology']",173,9

1676,1865,Towards the globalisation of the IS/IT function The IS/IT function has recently emerged from the peripheral aspects of the finance department to the centre of critical organisational change. There is an increasing dependency on its activities as systems extend beyond supporting the internal efficiency of the organisation to augmenting global performance. The growth of wide and local networks has resulted in communication possibilities that were not possible a few years ago. E-commerce challenges the achievements of the IS/IT function and is very prominent in the globalisation of modern organisations. The complexity and diversity of electronic exchange is also well documented Hackney et al. 2000). This has a number of impacts on the development and implementation of IS/IT solutions for organisations involved in international trade. It is a conjecture that the IS/IT function is critically important for the alignment of the business to meet the demands of global competition through building internal marketing strategies and creating knowledge based communities. There is clear evidence that IS/IT can lead to improved business performance and potentially for sustained competitive advantage. This is obviously true through the advent of new and emerging technologies such as the Internet,"['globalisation', 'IS/IT function', 'local area networks', 'wide area networks', 'e-commerce', 'electronic exchange', 'international trade', 'internal marketing strategies', 'knowledge based communities', 'Internet', 'business communication', 'electronic commerce', 'information systems', 'international trade', 'Internet', 'management of change']",192,16

The model consists of a linear block embedded between two static nonlinear gains. Hence it is called an N-L-N Hammerstein-Wiener model. First the model structure is motivated and the disturbance model is discussed. The paper then concentrates on parameter estimation. A relaxation iteration scheme is proposed by making use of a model structure in which the error is bilinear-in-parameters. This leads to a simple algorithm which minimizes the original loss function. The convergence and consistency of the algorithm are studied. In order to reduce the variance error the obtained linear model is further reduced using frequency weighted model reduction.

The successive provers while retaining the same underlying technology have used radically different algorithms and shown wide differences of behaviour. The development process has depended heavily on experiments with problems from the TPTP library and has been sharpened by participation in CASC each year since 1997. We outline some of the difficulties inherent in designing and refining a theorem prover as complex as SCOTT and explain our experimental methodology.

1687,1876,The development of CASC automated theorem proving Researchers who make theoretical advances also need some way to demonstrate that an advance really does have general overall positive consequences for system performance. For this it is necessary to evaluate the system on a set of problems that is sufficiently large and diverse to be somehow representative of the intended application area as a whole. It is only a small step from system evaluation to a communal system competition. The CADE ATP System Competition CASC has been run annually since 1996. Any competition is difficult to design and organize in the first instance and to then run over the years. In order to obtain the full benefits of a competition a thoroughly organized event with an unambiguous and motivated design is necessary. For some issues relevant to the CASC design inevitable constraints have emerged. For other issues there have been several choices and decisions have had to be made.

1694,1883,Analysis of exclusively kinetic two-link underactuated mechanical systems Analysis of exclusively kinetic two-link underactuated mechanical systems is undertaken. It is first shown that such systems are not full-state feedback linearizable around any equilibrium point. Also the equilibrium points for which the system is small-time locally controllable STLC is at most a one-dimensional submanifold. A concept less restrictive than STLC termed the small-time local output controllability STLOC is introduced the satisfaction of which guarantees that a chosen configuration output can be controlled at its desired value. It is shown that the class of systems considered is STLOC if the inertial coupling between the input and output is nonzero. Also in such a case the system is nonminimum phase.

1695,1884,Observer-based strict positive real SPR feedback control system design Presents theory for stability analysis and design for a class of observer-based feedback control systems. Relaxation of the controllability and observability conditions imposed in the Yakubovich-Kalman-Popov lemma can be made for a class of nonlinear systems described by a linear time-invariant system with a feedback-connected cone-bounded nonlinear element. It is shown how a circle-criterion approach can be used to design an observer-based state feedback control which yields a closed-loop system with specified robustness characteristics. The approach is relevant for design with preservation of stability when a cone-bounded nonlinearity is introduced in the feedback loop. Important applications are to be found in nonlinear control with high robustness requirements,"['observer-based strict positive real feedback control system', 'control system design', 'stability analysis', 'Yakubovich-Kalman-Popov lemma', 'nonlinear systems', 'linear time-invariant system', 'feedback-connected cone-bounded nonlinear element', 'circle-criterion approach', 'state feedback control', 'closed-loop system', 'robustness characteristics', 'cone-bounded nonlinearity', 'closed loop systems', 'control nonlinearities', 'control system synthesis', 'linear systems', 'nonlinear control systems', 'observers', 'robust control', 'stability criteria', 'state feedback']",116,21
1696,1885,Analysis of nonlinear time-delay systems using modules over non-commutative rings The theory of non-commutative rings is introduced to provide a basis for the study of nonlinear control systems with time delays. The left Ore ring of non-commutative polynomials defined over the field of a meromorphic function is suggested as the framework for such a study. This approach is then generalized to a broader class of nonlinear systems with delays that are called generalized Roesser systems. Finally the theory is applied to analyze nonlinear time-delay systems. A weak observability is defined and characterized generalizing the well-known linear result.

1697,1886,Non-asymptotic confidence ellipsoids for the least-squares estimate We consider the finite sample properties of least-squares system identification and derive non-asymptotic confidence ellipsoids for the estimate. The shape of the confidence ellipsoids is similar to the shape of the ellipsoids derived using asymptotic theory but unlike asymptotic theory they are valid for a finite number of data points.

1698,1887,Doubly invariant equilibria of linear discrete-time games The notion of doubly invariant DI equilibrium is introduced. The concept extends controlled and robustly controlled invariance notions to the context of two-person dynamic games. Each player tries to keep the state in a region of state space independently of the actions of the rival player. The paper gives existence conditions criteria and algorithms for the determination of DI equilibria of linear dynamic games in discrete time. Two examples illustrate the results.

1699,1888,L/sub 2 model reduction and variance reduction We examine certain variance properties of model reduction. The focus is on L/sub 2 model reduction but some general results are also presented. These general results can be used to analyze various other model reduction schemes. The models we study are finite impulse response FIR and output error OE models. We compare the variance of two estimated models. The first one is estimated directly from data and the other one is computed by reducing a high order model by L/sub 2 model reduction. In the FIR case we show that it is never better to estimate the model directly from data compared to estimating it via L/sub 2 model reduction of a high order FIR model. For OE models we show that the reduced model has the same variance as the directly estimated one if the reduced model class used contains the true system,"['L/sub 2/ model reduction', 'variance reduction', 'finite impulse response models', 'FIR models', 'output error models', 'identification', 'identification', 'reduced order systems']",151,8
1700,1889,Sliding mode dynamics in continuous feedback control for distributed discrete-event scheduling A continuous feedback control approach for real-time scheduling of discrete events is presented motivated by the need for control theoretic techniques to analyze and design such systems in distributed manufacturing applications. These continuous feedback control systems exhibit highly nonlinear and discontinuous dynamics. Specifically when the production demand in the manufacturing system exceeds the available resource capacity then the control system chatters and exhibits sliding modes. This sliding mode behavior is advantageously used in the scheduling application by allowing the system to visit different schedules within an infinitesimal region near the sliding surface. In the paper an analytical model is developed to characterize the sliding mode dynamics. This model is then used to design controllers in the sliding mode domain to improve the effectiveness of the control system to search for schedules with good performance. Computational results indicate that the continuous feedback control approach can provide near-optimal schedules and that it is computationally efficient compared to existing scheduling techniques,"['sliding mode dynamics', 'continuous feedback control', 'distributed discrete-event scheduling', 'real-time scheduling', 'control theoretic techniques', 'distributed manufacturing applications', 'highly nonlinear discontinuous dynamics', 'production demand', 'resource capacity', 'continuous time systems', 'discrete event systems', 'dynamics', 'feedback', 'production control', 'variable structure systems']",169,15

Adaptive controllers are proposed based on a suitable reduced dynamic model the defined reference signals and the mixed tracking errors. The proposed controllers not only ensure the entire state of the system to asymptotically converge to the desired trajectory but also ensure the constraint force to asymptotically converge to the desired force.

By establishing both upper and lower bounds on identification accuracy as functions of the length of observation size of unmodeled dynamics and stochastic disturbances we demonstrate the inherent impact of unmodeled dynamics on identification accuracy reduction of time complexity by stochastic averaging on disturbances and probing capability of full rank periodic signals for closed-loop persistent identification.

1704,1893,Closed-loop model set validation under a stochastic framework Deals with probabilistic model set validation. It is assumed that the dynamics of a multi-input multi-output MIMO plant is described by a model set with unstructured uncertainties and identification experiments are performed in closed loop. A necessary and sufficient condition has been derived for the consistency of the model set with both the stabilizing controller and closed-loop frequency domain experimental data FDED). In this condition only the Euclidean norm of a complex vector is involved and this complex vector depends linearly on both the disturbances and the measurement errors. Based on this condition an analytic formula has been derived for the sample unfalsified probability SUP of the model set. Some of the asymptotic statistical properties of the SUP have also been briefly discussed.

1706,1895,An algorithm combining neural networks with fundamental parameters An algorithm combining neural networks with the fundamental parameters equations NNFP is proposed for making corrections for non-linear matrix effects in x-ray fluorescence analysis. In the algorithm neural networks were applied to relate the concentrations of components to both the measured intensities and the relative theoretical intensities calculated by the fundamental parameter equations. The NNFP algorithm is compared with the classical theoretical correction models including the fundamental parameters approach the Lachance-Traill model a hyperbolic function model and the COLA algorithm. For an alloy system with 15 measured elements in most cases the prediction errors of the NNFP algorithm are lower than those of the fundamental parameters approach the Lachance-Traill model the hyperbolic function model and the COLA algorithm separately. If there are the serious matrix effects such as matrix effects among Cr Fe and Ni the NNFP algorithm generally decreased predictive errors as compared with the classical models except for the case of Cr by the fundamental parameters approach. The main reason why the NNFP algorithm has generally a better predictive ability than the classical theoretical correction models might be that neural networks can better calibrate the non-linear matrix effects in a complex multivariate system,"['algorithm', 'neural networks', 'fundamental parameters', 'fundamental parameters equations', 'nonlinear matrix effects', 'x-ray fluorescence analysis', 'intensities', 'NNFP algorithm', 'theoretical correction models', 'Lachance-Traill model', 'hyperbolic function model', 'COLA algorithm', 'alloy system', 'Cr', 'Fe', 'Ni', 'complex multivariate system', 'chromium alloys', 'iron alloys', 'neural nets', 'nickel alloys', 'spectroscopy computing', 'X-ray fluorescence analysis']",203,23

The wagon runs on an ideal straight and level track with constant speed. The lateral dynamics in dependence on the speed is examined. We have included stick-slip and hysteresis in our model of the dry friction and assume that Coulomb's law holds during the slip phase.

1708,1897,User-appropriate tyre-modelling for vehicle dynamics in standard and limit situations When modelling vehicles for the vehicle dynamic simulation special attention must be paid to the modelling of tyre forces and torques according to their dominant influence on the results. This task is not only about sufficiently exact representation of the effective forces but also about user-friendly and practical relevant applicability especially when the experimental tyre-input-data is incomplete or missing. This text firstly describes the basics of the vehicle dynamic tyre model conceived to be a physically based semi-empirical model for application in connection with multi-body-systems MBS). On the basis of tyres for a passenger car and a heavy truck the simulated steady state tyre characteristics are shown together and compared with the underlying experimental values.

1709,1898,Design of a stroke dependent damper for the front axle suspension of a truck using multibody system dynamics and numerical optimization A stroke dependent damper is designed for the front axle suspension of a truck. The damper supplies extra damping for inward deflections rising above 4 cm. In this way the damper should reduce extreme suspension deflections without deteriorating the comfort of the truck. But the question is which stroke dependent damping curve yields the best compromise between suspension deflection working space and comfort. Therefore an optimization problem is defined to minimize the maximum inward suspension deflection subject to constraints on the chassis acceleration for three typical road undulations. The optimization problem is solved using sequential linear programming SLP and multibody dynamics simulation software. Several optimization runs have been carried out for a small two degree of freedom vehicle model and a large full-scale model of the truck semi-trailer combination. The results show that the stroke dependent damping can reduce large deflections at incidental road disturbances but that the optimum stroke dependent damping curve is related to the acceleration bound. By means of vehicle model simulation and numerical optimization we have been able to quantify this trade-off between suspension deflection working space and truck comfort,"['stroke dependent damper', 'front axle suspension', 'multibody system dynamics', 'numerical optimization', 'inward deflections', 'extreme suspension deflections', 'chassis acceleration', 'road undulations', 'sequential linear programming', 'full-scale model', 'truck semi-trailer combination', 'damping', 'incidental road disturbances', 'acceleration bound', 'vehicle model simulation', 'truck comfort', 'damping', 'digital simulation', 'dynamics', 'linear programming', 'mechanical variables control', 'road vehicles']",205,22
1710,1899,Human face detection in visual scenes using neural networks This paper presents a neural network based face detection system. Our objective is to design a system that can detect human faces in visual scenes at high searching speed and accuracy. We used a neural network with a simple structure but trained using face and non-face samples preprocessed by several methods position normalization histogram equalization etc. to attain high accuracy then pruned the size of the neural network so that it could run faster and reduced the total search area of a target visual scene using the skin color detector. Skin color detection assumes that faces reside only in skin color regions. The system design is made up of two parts the face detecting system that detects the faces and the searching speed improving system. Speed improvement is achieved by reducing the face locator network size using the structural learning with knowledge and by reducing the face search area using the skin color detection system. Faster training of the neural networks was also achieved using variable step sizes,"['backpropagation', 'self organizing maps', 'down-sampling', 'neural network', 'human face recognition', 'visual scene', 'skin color detector', 'face detecting system', 'merging overlapping detections', 'backpropagation', 'computer vision', 'face recognition', 'image colour analysis', 'neural nets']",177,14

1714,1903,The BLISS programming language a history The BLISS programming language was invented by William A. Wulf and others at Carnegie-Mellon University in 1969 originally for the DEC PDP-10. BLISS-10 caught the interest of Ronald F. Brender of DEC Digital Equipment Corporation). After several years of collaboration including the creation of BLISS-11 for the PDP-11 BLISS was adopted as DEC's implementation language for use on its new line of VAX computers in 1975. DEC developed a completely new generation of BLISSs for the VAX PDP-10 and PDP-11 which became widely used at DEC during the 1970s and 1980s. With the creation of the Alpha architecture in the early 1990s BLISS was extended again in both 32 and 64-bit flavors. BLISS support for the Intel IA-32 architecture was introduced in 1995 and IA-64 support is now in progress. BLISS has a number of unusual characteristics it is typeless requires use of an explicit contents of operator written as a period or dot takes an algorithmic approach to data structure definition has no goto is an expression language and has an unusually rich compile-time language. This paper reviews the evolution and use of BLISS over its three decade lifetime. Emphasis is on how the language evolved to facilitate portable programming while retaining its initial highly machine-specific character.

Doing so ensures that-downstream process sequences operate on work-in-progress that is well within control. Because point-of-use visibility of work-in-progress quality has become of paramount concern in the industry's drive to reduce scrap and improve yield controlling trench depth has assumed greater importance.

1721,1910,Breast cancer effectiveness of computer-aided diagnosis-observer study with independent database of mammograms Evaluates the effectiveness of a computerized classification method as an aid to radiologists reviewing clinical mammograms for which the diagnoses were unknown to both the radiologists and the computer. Six mammographers and six community radiologists participated in an observer study. These 12 radiologists interpreted with and without the computer aid 110 cases that were unknown to both the 12 radiologist observers and the trained computer classification scheme. The radiologists performances in differentiating between benign and malignant masses without and with the computer aid were evaluated with receiver operating characteristic ROC analysis. Two-tailed P values were calculated for the Student t test to indicate the statistical significance of the differences in performances with and without the computer aid. When the computer aid was used the average performance of the 12 radiologists improved as indicated by an increase in the area under the ROC curve A/sub z from 0.93 to 0.96 P<.001 by an increase in partial area under the ROC curve sub 0.9/0A'/sub z from 0.56 to 0.72 P<.001 and by an increase in sensitivity from 94 to 98 P=.022). No statistically significant difference in specificity was found between readings with and those without computer aid  Delta +-0.014 P=.46 95 Cl 0.054 0.026 where Delta is difference in specificity.

1722,1911,Pulmonary perfusion patterns and pulmonary arterial pressure Uses artificial intelligence methods to determine whether quantitative parameters describing the perfusion image can be synthesized to make a reasonable estimate of the pulmonary arterial PA pressure measured at angiography. Radionuclide perfusion images were obtained in 120 patients with normal chest radiographs who also underwent angiographic PA pressure measurement within 3 days of the radionuclide study. An artificial neural network ANN was constructed from several image parameters describing statistical and boundary characteristics of the perfusion images. With use of a leave-one-out cross-validation technique this method was used to predict the PA systolic pressure in cases on which the ANN had not been trained. A Pearson correlation coefficient was determined between the predicted and measured PA systolic pressures. ANN predictions correlated with measured pulmonary systolic pressures r=0.846 P<.001). The accuracy of the predictions was not influenced by the presence of pulmonary embolism. None of the 51 patients with predicted PA pressures of less than 29 mm Hg had pulmonary hypertension at angiography. All 13 patients with predicted PA pressures greater than 48 mm Hg had pulmonary hypertension at angiography. Meaningful information regarding PA pressure can be derived from noninvasive radionuclide perfusion scanning.

1725,1914,Vacuum-compatible vibration isolation stack for an interferometric gravitational wave detector TAMA300 Interferometric gravitational wave detectors require a large degree of vibration isolation. For this purpose a multilayer stack constructed of rubber and metal blocks is suitable because it provides isolation in all degrees of freedom at once. In TAMA300 a 300 m interferometer in Japan long-term dimensional stability and compatibility with an ultrahigh vacuum environment of about 10/sup 6 Pa are also required. To keep the interferometer at its operating point despite ground strain and thermal drift of the isolation system a thermal actuator was introduced. To prevent the high outgassing rate of the rubber from spoiling the vacuum the rubber blocks were enclosed by gas-tight bellows. Using these techniques we have successfully developed a three-layer stack which has a vibration isolation ratio of more than 10/sup 3 at 300 Hz with control of drift and enough vacuum compatibility,"['vibration isolation stack', 'TAMA300 interferometer', 'interferometric gravitational wave detectors', 'rubber blocks', 'multilayer stack', 'metal blocks', 'long-term dimensional stability', 'ultrahigh vacuum environment', 'operating point', 'ground strain', 'thermal drift', 'thermal actuator', 'gas-tight bellows', 'rubber outgassing', 'vacuum compatibility', '300 m', '10/sup -6/ Pa', '300 Hz', 'actuators', 'gravitational wave detectors', 'light interferometers', 'mechanical stability', 'rubber', 'thermal stability', 'vibration isolation']",149,25

1728,1917,Design and modeling of an interval-based ABR flow control protocol A novel flow control protocol is presented for availability bit rate ABR service in asynchronous transfer mode ATM networks.

1729,1918,Negotiating the semantics of agent communication languages This article presents a formal framework and outlines a method that autonomous agents can use to negotiate the semantics of their communication language at run-time. Such an ability is needed in open multi-agent systems so that agents can ensure they understand the implications of the utterances that are being made and so that they can tailor the meaning of the primitives to best fit their prevailing circumstances. To this end the semantic space framework provides a systematic means of classifying the primitives along multiple relevant dimensions. This classification can then be used by the agents to structure their negotiation or semantic fixing process so that they converge to the mutually agreeable semantics that are necessary for coherent social interactions,"['autonomous agents', 'multi-agent systems', 'communication language', 'semantic fixing', 'semantic space', 'social interactions', 'formal languages', 'multi-agent systems', 'programming language semantics']",126,9
1730,1919,Toward a formalism for conversation protocols using joint intention theory Conversation protocols are used to achieve certain goals or to bring about certain states in the world. Therefore one may identify the landmarks or the states that must be brought about during the goal-directed execution of a protocol. Accordingly the landmarks characterized by propositions that are true in the state represented by that landmark are the most important aspect of a protocol. Families of conversation protocols can be expressed formally as partially ordered landmarks after the landmarks necessary to achieve a goal have been identified. Concrete protocols represented as joint action expressions can then be derived from the partially ordered landmarks and executed directly by joint intention interpreters. This approach of applying Joint Intention theory to protocols also supports flexibility in the actions used to get to landmarks shortcutting protocol execution automatic exception handling and correctness criterion for protocols and protocol compositions,"['conversation protocols', 'protocol execution', 'automatic exception handling', 'correctness criterion', 'multi-agent interactions', 'finite state machines', 'finite state machines', 'multi-agent systems', 'protocols']",152,9
1731,1920,To commit or not to commit modeling agent conversations for action Conversations are sequences of messages exchanged among interacting agents. For conversations to be meaningful agents ought to follow commonly known specifications limiting the types of messages that can be exchanged at any point in the conversation. These specifications are usually implemented using conversation policies which are rules of inference or conversation protocols which are predefined conversation templates). In this article we present a semantic model for specifying conversations using conversation policies. This model is based on the principles that the negotiation and uptake of shared social commitments entail the adoption of obligations to action which indicate the actions that agents have agreed to perform. In the same way obligations are retracted based on the negotiation to discharge their corresponding shared social commitments. Based on these principles conversations are specified as interaction specifications that model the ideal sequencing of agent participations negotiating the execution of actions in a joint activity. These specifications not only specify the adoption and discharge of shared commitments and obligations during an activity but also indicate the commitments and obligations that are required as preconditions or that outlive a joint activity as postconditions). We model the Contract Net Protocol as an example of the specification of conversations in a joint activity,"['interacting agents', 'specifications', 'rules of inference', 'conversation protocols', 'autonomous agents', 'social commitments', 'speech acts', 'software agents', 'conversation templates', 'formal languages', 'software agents']",215,11
1732,1921,An ACL for a dynamic system of agents In this article we present the design of an ACL for a dynamic system of agents. The ACL includes a set of conversation performatives extended with operations to register create and terminate agents. The main design goal at the agent-level is to provide only knowledge-level primitives that are well integrated with the dynamic nature of the system. This goal has been achieved by defining an anonymous interaction protocol which enables agents to request and supply knowledge without considering symbol-level issues concerning management of agent names routing and agent reachability. This anonymous interaction protocol exploits a distributed facilitator schema which is hidden at the agent-level and provides mechanisms for registering capabilities of agents and delivering requests according to the competence of agents. We present a formal specification of the ACL and of the underlying architecture exploiting an algebra of actors and illustrate it with the help of a graphical notation. This approach provides the basis for discussing dynamic primitives in ACL and for studying properties of dynamic multi agent systems for example concerning the behavior of agents and the correctness of their conversation policies,"['ACL', 'dynamic system of agents', 'system of agents', 'agents', 'Agent Communication Languages', 'dynamic system', 'distributed facilitator', 'actors', 'anonymous interaction protocol', 'high level languages', 'multi-agent systems', 'software agents']",191,12
1733,1922,Trends in agent communication language Agent technology is an exciting and important new way to create complex software systems. Agents blend many of the traditional properties of AI programs  knowledge-level reasoning flexibility proactiveness goal-directedness and so forth  with insights gained from distributed software engineering machine learning negotiation and teamwork theory and the social sciences. An important part of the agent approach is the principle that agents like humans can function more effectively in groups that are characterized by cooperation and division of labor. Agent programs are designed to autonomously collaborate with each other in order to satisfy both their internal goals and the shared external demands generated by virtue of their participation in agent societies. This type of collaboration depends on a sophisticated system of inter-agent communication. The assumption that inter-agent communication is best handled through the explicit use of an agent communication language ACL underlies each of the articles in this special issue.

1753,1942,Precoded OFDM with adaptive vector channel allocation for scalable video transmission over frequency-selective fading channels Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM has been applied in broadband wireline and wireless systems for high data rate transmission where severe intersymbol interference ISI always occurs. The conventional OFDM system provides advantages through conversion of an ISI channel into ISI-free subchannels at multiple frequency bands. However it may suffer from channel spectral nulls and heavy data rate overhead due to cyclic prefix insertion. Previously a new OFDM framework the precoded OFDM has been proposed to mitigate the above two problems through precoding and conversion of an ISI channel into ISI-free vector channels. In this paper we consider the application of the precoded OFDM system to efficient scalable video transmission. We propose to enhance the precoded OFDM system with adaptive vector channel allocation to provide stronger protection against errors to more important layers in the layered bit stream structure of scalable video. The more critical layers or equivalently the lower layers are allocated vector channels of higher transmission quality. The channel quality is characterized by Frobenius norm metrics based on channel estimation at the receiver. The channel allocation information is fed back periodically to the transmitter through a control channel.

1754,1943,I-WAP an intelligent WAP site management system The popularity regarding wireless communications is such that more and more WAP sites have been developed with wireless markup language WML). Meanwhile to translate hypertext markup language HTML pages into proper WML ones becomes imperative since it is difficult for WAP users to read most contents designed for PC users via their mobile phone screens. However for those sites that have been maintained with hypertext markup language HTML considerable time and manpower costs will be incurred to rebuild them with WML. In this paper we propose an intelligent WAP site management system to cope with these problems. With the help of the intelligent management system the original contents of HTML Web sites can be automatically translated to proper WAP content in an efficient way. As a consequence the costs associated with maintaining WAP sites could be significantly reduced. The management system also allows the system manager to define the relevance of numerals and keywords for removing unimportant or meaningless contents. The original contents will be reduced and reorganized to fit the size of mobile phone screens thus reducing the communication cost and enhancing readability. Numerical results gained through various experiments have evinced the effective performance of the WAP management system,"['intelligent WAP site management system', 'I-WAP', 'wireless communication', 'wireless markup language', 'hypertext markup language', 'HTML pages', 'mobile phone', 'communication cost', 'readability', 'wireless mobile Internet', 'computer network management', 'hypermedia markup languages', 'Internet', 'mobile computing', 'mobile radio']",207,15

1756,1945,The development of a mobile manipulator imaging system for bridge crack inspection A mobile manipulator imaging system is developed for the automation of bridge crack inspection. During bridge safety inspections an eyesight inspection is made for preliminary evaluation and screening before a more precise inspection. The inspection for cracks is an important part of the preliminary evaluation. Currently the inspectors must stand on the platform of a bridge inspection vehicle or a temporarily erected scaffolding to examine the underside of a bridge. However such a procedure is risky. To help automate the bridge crack inspection process we installed two CCD cameras and a four-axis manipulator system on a mobile vehicle. The parallel cameras are used to detect cracks. The manipulator system is equipped with binocular charge coupled devices CCD for examining structures that may not be accessible to the eye. The system also reduces the danger of accidents to the human inspectors. The manipulator system consists of four arms. Balance weights are placed at the ends of arms 2 and 4 respectively to maintain the center of gravity during operation. Mechanically arms 2 and 4 can revolve smoothly.

1763,1952,Comprehensive encoding and decoupling solution to problems of decoherence and design in solid-state quantum computing Proposals for scalable quantum computing devices suffer not only from decoherence due to the interaction with their environment but also from severe engineering constraints. Here we introduce a practical solution to these major concerns addressing solid-state proposals in particular. Decoherence is first reduced by encoding a logical qubit into two qubits then completely eliminated by an efficient set of decoupling pulse sequences. The same encoding removes the need for single-qubit operations which pose a difficult design constraint. We further show how the dominant decoherence processes can be identified empirically in order to optimize the decoupling pulses,"['solid-state quantum computing', 'decoherence', 'logical qubit encoding', 'pulse sequence decoupling', 'engineering constraints', 'decoupling pulse optimization', 'scalable quantum computing devices', 'exchange Hamiltonian', 'encoding', 'exchange interactions (electron)', 'quantum computing', 'semiconductor quantum dots']",111,12

The mass media shift the percolative phase transition observed in the model and decrease the time after which the stationary state is reached,"['social percolation', 'mass media influence', 'Solomon-Weisbuch marketing model', 'quality expectations', 'ghost field', 'percolative phase transition', 'stationary state', 'customers', 'cinema', 'external field', 'cinematography', 'marketing', 'percolation', 'phase transformations', 'socio-economic effects']",82,15
1765,1954,Estimating long-range dependence finite sample properties and confidence intervals A major issue in financial economics is the behavior of asset returns over long horizons. Various estimators of long-range dependence have been proposed. Even though some have known asymptotic properties it is important to test their accuracy by using simulated series of different lengths. We test R/S analysis detrended fluctuation analysis and periodogram regression methods on samples drawn from Gaussian white noise. The DFA statistics turns out to be the unanimous winner. Unfortunately no asymptotic distribution theory has been derived for this statistics so far. We were able however to construct empirical i.e. approximate confidence intervals for all three methods. The obtained values differ largely from heuristic values proposed by some authors for the R/S statistics and are very close to asymptotic values for the periodogram regression method,"['long-range dependence', 'finite sample properties', 'confidence intervals', 'financial economics', 'asset returns', 'long horizons', 'asymptotic properties', 'detrended fluctuation analysis', 'periodogram regression methods', 'Gaussian white noise', 'heuristic values', 'economics', 'finance', 'fluctuations', 'Gaussian noise', 'investment', 'white noise']",137,17
1766,1955,Simulation of evacuation processes using a bionics-inspired cellular automaton model for pedestrian dynamics We present simulations of evacuation processes using a recently introduced cellular automaton model for pedestrian dynamics. This model applies a bionics approach to describe the interaction between the pedestrians using ideas from chemotaxis. Here we study a rather simple situation namely the evacuation from a large room with one or two doors. It is shown that the variation of the model parameters allows to describe different types of behaviour from regular to panic. We find a non-monotonic dependence of the evacuation times on the coupling constants. These times depend on the strength of the herding behaviour with minimal evacuation times for some intermediate values of the couplings i.e. a proper combination of herding and use of knowledge about the shortest way to the exit,"['evacuation processes simulation', 'chemotaxis', 'nonmonotonic dependence', 'coupling constants', 'herding behaviour', 'bionics-inspired cellular automaton model', 'pedestrian dynamics', 'biocybernetics', 'cellular automata']",137,9
1767,1956,Dynamical transition to periodic motions of a recurrent bus induced by nonstops We study the dynamical behavior of a recurrent bus on a circular route with many bus stops when the recurrent bus passes some bus stops without stopping. The recurrent time one period is described in terms of a nonlinear map. It is shown that the recurrent bus exhibits the complex periodic behaviors. The dynamical transitions to periodic motions occur by increasing nonstops. The periodic motions depend on the property of an attractor of the nonlinear map. The period n of the attractor varies sensitively with the number of nonstops,"['dynamical transition', 'periodic motions', 'recurrent bus', 'nonstops', 'circular route', 'recurrent time', 'nonlinear map', 'complex periodic behaviors', 'attractor', 'nonlinear dynamical systems', 'phase transformations', 'road traffic']",101,12

Danuta Makowiec gave an improved model based on the lattice where the restraining factor of the four neighbours take the place of the Verhulst factor. Here we discuss the two populations Penna model with predation on the planar lattice of two dimensions. A cellular automata model containing movable wolves and sheep has been built.

1771,1960,Streaming disruptive interference and power-law behavior in the exit dynamics of confined pedestrians We analyze the exit dynamics of pedestrians who are initially confined in a room. Pedestrians are modeled as cellular automata and compete to escape via a known exit at the soonest possible time. A pedestrian could move forward backward left or right within each iteration time depending on adjacent cell vacancy and in accordance with simple rules that determine the compulsion to move and physical capability relative to his neighbors. The arching signatures of jamming were observed and the pedestrians exited in bursts of various sizes. Power-law behavior is found in the burst-size frequency distribution for exit widths w greater than one cell dimension w  1). The slope of the power-law curve varies with w from 1.3092 w = 2 to 1.0720 w = 20). Streaming which is a diffusive behavior arises in large burst sizes and is more likely in a single-exit room with w = 1 and leads to a counterintuitive result wherein an average exit throughput Q is obtained that is higher than with w = 2 3 or 4. For a two-exit room w = 1 Q is not greater than twice the yield of a single-exit room. If the doors are not separated far enough  4w Q becomes even significantly less due to a collective slow-down that emerges among pedestrians crossing in each other's path disruptive interference effect). For the same w and door number Q is also higher with relaxed pedestrians than with anxious ones,"['streaming', 'cellular automata', 'iteration time', 'adjacent cell vacancy', 'arching signatures', 'jamming', 'burst-size frequency distribution', 'collective slow-down', 'self-organised criticality', 'disruptive interference', 'power-law behavior', 'exit dynamics', 'confined pedestrians', 'cellular automata', 'iterative methods', 'nonlinear dynamical systems', 'self-organised criticality', 'transport processes', 'transportation']",254,19
1772,1961,The influence of tollbooths on highway traffic We study the effects of tollbooths on the traffic flow. The highway traffic is simulated by the Nagel-Schreckenberg model. Various types of toll collection are examined which can be characterized either by a waiting time or a reduced speed. A first-order phase transition is observed. The phase separation results a saturated flow which is observed as a plateau region in the fundamental diagram. The effects of lane expansion near the tollbooth are examined. The full capacity of a highway can be restored. The emergence of vehicle queuing is studied. Besides the numerical results we also obtain analytical expressions for various quantities. The numerical simulations can be well described by the analytical formulas. We also discuss the influence on the travel time and its variance. The tollbooth increases the travel time but decreases its variance. The differences between long and short-distance travelers are also discussed,"['highway traffic', 'tollbooths', 'Nagel-Schreckenberg model', 'toll collection', 'waiting time', 'reduced speed', 'first-order phase transition', 'saturated flow', 'lane expansion', 'vehicle queuing', 'numerical simulations', 'road traffic']",151,12

1774,1963,The variance of firm growth rates the scaling puzzle Recent evidence suggests that a power-law relationship exists between a firm's size and the variance of its growth rate. The flatness of the relation is regarded as puzzling in that it suggests that large firms are not much more stable than small firms. It has been suggested that the powerlaw nature of the relationship reflects the presence of some form of correlation of growth rates across the firm's constituent businesses. Here it is shown that a model of independent businesses which allows for the fact that these businesses vary in size as modelled by a simple partitions of integers model provides a good representation of what is observed empirically,"['firm growth rates', 'scaling puzzle', 'power-law', 'flatness', 'correlation', 'constituent businesses', 'partitions of integers model', 'size distribution', 'corporate growth', 'corporate modelling', 'economics', 'fluctuations', 'nonlinear dynamical systems', 'probability', 'statistical mechanics']",118,15

1776,1965,Stock market dynamics We elucidate on several empirical statistical observations of stock market returns. Moreover we find that these properties are recurrent and are also present in invariant measures of low-dimensional dynamical systems. Thus we propose that the returns are modeled by the first Poincare return time of a low-dimensional chaotic trajectory. This modeling which captures the recurrent properties of the return fluctuations is able to predict well the evolution of the observed statistical quantities. In addition it explains the reason for which stocks present simultaneously dynamical properties and high uncertainties. In our analysis we use data from the S&P 500 index and the Brazilian stock Telebras,"['stock market returns', 'empirical statistical observations', 'invariant measures', 'low-dimensional dynamical systems', 'first Poincare return time', 'low-dimensional chaotic trajectory', 'statistical quantities', 'Brazilian stock', 'econophysics', 'chaos', 'economic cybernetics', 'stock markets']",107,12
1777,1966,Application of nonlinear time series analysis techniques to high-frequency currency exchange data In this work we have applied nonlinear time series analysis to high-frequency currency exchange data. The time series studied are the exchange rates between the US Dollar and 18 other foreign currencies from within and without the Euro zone. Our goal was to determine if their dynamical behaviours were in some way correlated. The nonexistence of stationarity called for the application of recurrence quantification analysis as a tool for this analysis and is based on the definition of several parameters that allow for the quantification of recurrence plots. The method was checked using the European Monetary System currency exchanges. The results show as expected the high correlation between the currencies that are part of the Euro but also a strong correlation between the Japanese Yen the Canadian Dollar and the British Pound.

The realized volatility and logarithmic standard deviations are constructed following the methodology of Andersen et al. J. Am. Stat. Ass. 96 2001 42-55 using intra-day transaction data. We find that SSA decomposes the volatility series quite well and effectively captures both the market trend accounting for about 34-38 of the total variance in the series and more importantly a number of underlying market periodicities.

1779,1968,Phase control of higher-order squeezing of a quantum field In a recent experiment Phys. Rev. Lett. 88 2002 023601 phase-dependent photon statistics in a c.w. system has been observed in the mixing of a coherent field with a two-photon source. Their system has the advantage over other atomic transition-based fluorescent systems. In this paper we examine further the squeezing properties of higher-order quantum fluctuations in one of the quadrature components of the combined field in this system. We demonstrate that efficient and lasting higher-order squeezing effects could be observed with proper choice of the relative phase between the pump and coherent fields. This nonclassical feature is attributed to a constructive two-photon interference.

1780,1969,Modeling self-consistent multi-class dynamic traffic flow In this study we present a systematic self-consistent multiclass multilane traffic model derived from the vehicular Boltzmann equation and the traffic dispersion model. The multilane domain is considered as a two-dimensional space and the interaction among vehicles in the domain is described by a dispersion model. The reason we consider a multilane domain as a two-dimensional space is that the driving behavior of road users may not be restricted by lanes especially motorcyclists. The dispersion model which is a nonlinear Poisson equation is derived from the car-following theory and the equilibrium assumption. Under the concept that all kinds of users share the finite section the density is distributed on a road by the dispersion model. In addition the dynamic evolution of the traffic flow is determined by the systematic gas-kinetic model derived from the Boltzmann equation. Multiplying Boltzmann equation by the zeroth first and second-order moment functions integrating both side of the equation and using chain rules we can derive continuity motion and variance equation respectively. However the second-order moment function which is the square of the individual velocity is employed by previous researches does not have physical meaning in traffic flow,"['self-consistent multiclass dynamic traffic flow modeling', 'multilane traffic model', 'vehicular Boltzmann equation', 'traffic dispersion model', 'road users', 'nonlinear Poisson equation', 'car-following theory', 'dynamic evolution', 'variance equation', 'motion equation', 'Poisson equation', 'Boltzmann equation', 'flow simulation', 'multiphase flow', 'nonlinear differential equations', 'Poisson equation', 'road traffic']",198,17

1782,1971,Exploring developments in Web based relationship marketing within the hotel industry This paper provides a content analysis study of the application of World Wide Web marketing by the hotel industry. There is a lack of historical perspective on industry related Web marketing applications and this paper attempts to resolve this with a two-year follow-up case study of the changing use of the Web to develop different types of relationships. Specifically the aims are 1 to identify key changes in the way hotels are using the Web 2 to look for evidence of the adoption of a relationship marketing RM model as a strategy for the development of hotel Web sites and the use of new technologies and 3 To investigate the use of multimedia in hotel Web sites. The development and strategic exploitation of the Internet has transformed the basis of marketing. Using the evidence from a Web content survey this study reveals the way relationships are being created and managed within the hotel industry by its use of the Web as a marketing tool. The authors have collected evidence by means of a descriptive study on the way hotels build and create relationships with their Web presence delivering multimedia information as well as channel and interactive means of communication. In addition a strategic framework is offered as the means to describe the mechanism and orientation of Web based marketing by hotels. The study utilizes a model by Gilbert 1996 as a means of developing a measurement instrument to allow a content analysis of the current approach by hotels to the development of Web sites.

1783,1972,Online auctions dynamic pricing and the lodging industry The traditional channels of distribution for overnight accommodation are rapidly being displaced by Web site scripting online intermediaries and specialty brokers. Businesses that pioneered Internet usage relied on it as a sales and marketing alternative to predecessor product distribution channels. As such Web sites replace the traditional trading model to the Internet. Web-enabled companies are popular because the medium renders the process faster less costly highly reliable and secure. Auction-based models impact business models by converting the price setting mechanism from supplier-centric to market-centric and transforming the trading model from one to many to many to many. Historically pricing was based on the cost of production plus a margin of profit. Traditionally as products and services move through the supply chain from the producer to the consumer various intermediaries added their share of profit to the price. As Internet based mediums of distribution become more prevalent traditional pricing models are being supplanted with dynamic pricing. A dynamic pricing model represents a flexible system that changes prices not only from product to product but also from customer to customer and transaction to transaction. Many industry leaders are skeptical of the long run impact of online auctions on lodging industry profit margins despite the fact pricing theory suggests that an increase in the flow of information results in efficient market pricing. The future of such endeavors remains promising but controversial,"['online auctions', 'dynamic pricing', 'lodging industry', 'overnight accommodations', 'Web site scripting', 'online intermediaries', 'specialty brokers', 'Internet usage', 'sales', 'marketing', 'trading model', 'business models', 'price setting mechanism', 'supply chain', 'costing', 'electronic commerce', 'information resources', 'Internet', 'travel industry']",236,19

This paper deals with the real-time implementation of SPIHT algorithm using DSP chip. In order to facilitate the implementation and improve the codec's performance some relative issues are thoroughly discussed such as the optimization of program structure to speed up the wavelet decomposition. SPIHT's high memory requirement is a major drawback for hardware implementation. In this paper we modify the original SPIHT algorithm by presenting two new concepts-number of error bits and absolute zerotree. Consequently the memory cost is significantly reduced. We also introduce a new method to control the coding process by number of error bits.

1786,1975,Efficient computation of local geometric moments Local moments have attracted attention as local features in applications such as edge detection and texture segmentation. The main reason for this is that they are inherently integral-based features so that their use reduces the effect of uncorrelated noise. The computation of local moments when viewed as a neighborhood operation can be interpreted as a convolution of the image with a set of masks. Nevertheless moments computed inside overlapping windows are not independent and convolution does not take this fact into account. By introducing a matrix formulation and the concept of accumulation moments this paper presents an algorithm which is computationally much more efficient than convolving and yet as simple,"['local geometric moments computation', 'local features', 'edge detection', 'texture segmentation', 'integral-based features', 'neighborhood operation', 'image convolution', 'overlapping windows', 'matrix formulation', 'accumulation moments', 'computationally efficient algorithm', 'image analysis', 'convolution', 'edge detection', 'image processing', 'image segmentation', 'image texture', 'matrix algebra']",116,18
1787,1976,Adaptive image denoising using scale and space consistency This paper proposes a new method for image denoising with edge preservation based on image multiresolution decomposition by a redundant wavelet transform. In our approach edges are implicitly located and preserved in the wavelet domain whilst image noise is filtered out. At each resolution level the image edges are estimated by gradient magnitudes obtained from the wavelet coefficients which are modeled probabilistically and a shrinkage function is assembled based on the model obtained. Joint use of space and scale consistency is applied for better preservation of edges. The shrinkage functions are combined to preserve edges that appear simultaneously at several resolutions and geometric constraints are applied to preserve edges that are not isolated. The proposed technique produces a filtered version of the original image where homogeneous regions appear separated by well-defined edges. Possible applications include image presegmentation and image denoising,"['adaptive image denoising', 'scale consistency', 'space consistency', 'edge preservation', 'image multiresolution decomposition', 'redundant wavelet transform', 'image edges', 'gradient magnitudes', 'shrinkage function', 'geometric constraints', 'edge enhancement', 'adaptive signal processing', 'edge detection', 'image enhancement', 'image resolution', 'image restoration', 'interference suppression', 'wavelet transforms']",148,18
1788,1977,Tracking nonparameterized object contours in video We propose a new method for contour tracking in video. The inverted distance transform of the edge map is used as an edge indicator function for contour detection. Using the concept of topographical distance the watershed segmentation can be formulated as a minimization. This new viewpoint gives a way to combine the results of the watershed algorithm on different surfaces. In particular our algorithm determines the contour as a combination of the current edge map and the contour predicted from the tracking result in the previous frame. We also show that the problem of background clutter can be relaxed by taking the object motion into account. The compensation with object motion allows to detect and remove spurious edges in background. The experimental results confirm the expected advantages of the proposed method over the existing approaches,"['contour tracking', 'nonparameterized object contours', 'edge indicator function', 'topographical distance', 'watershed segmentation', 'minimization', 'background clutter', 'object motion', 'motion analysis', 'video', 'inverted distance transform', 'edge map', 'motion estimation', 'edge detection', 'edge detection', 'image motion analysis', 'motion compensation', 'motion estimation', 'tracking', 'video signal processing']",141,20
1789,1978,Multilayered image representation application to image compression The main contribution of this work is a new paradigm for image representation and image compression. We describe a new multilayered representation technique for images. An image is parsed into a superposition of coherent layers piecewise smooth regions layer textures layer etc. The multilayered decomposition algorithm consists in a cascade of compressions applied successively to the image itself and to the residuals that resulted from the previous compressions. During each iteration of the algorithm we code the residual part in a lossy way we only retain the most significant structures of the residual part which results in a sparse representation. Each layer is encoded independently with a different transform or basis at a different bitrate and the combination of the compressed layers can always be reconstructed in a meaningful way. The strength of the multilayer approach comes from the fact that different sets of basis functions complement each others some of the basis functions will give reasonable account of the large trend of the data while others will catch the local transients or the oscillatory patterns. This multilayered representation has a lot of beautiful applications in image understanding and image and video coding. We have implemented the algorithm and we have studied its capabilities,"['image compression', 'multilayered representation', 'image representation', 'piecewise smooth regions layer', 'textures layer', 'multilayered decomposition algorithm', 'residual part', 'sparse representation', 'basis functions', 'wavelet transforms', 'cosine transforms', 'transform coding', 'data compression', 'image coding', 'image representation', 'transform coding']",211,16
1790,1979,Combining spatial and scale-space techniques for edge detection to provide a spatially adaptive wavelet-based noise filtering algorithm New methods for detecting edges in an image using spatial and scale-space domains are proposed. A priori knowledge about geometrical characteristics of edges is used to assign a probability factor to the chance of any pixel being on an edge. An improved double thresholding technique is introduced for spatial domain filtering. Probabilities that pixels belong to a given edge are assigned based on pixel similarity across gradient amplitudes gradient phases and edge connectivity. The scale-space approach uses dynamic range compression to allow wavelet correlation over a wider range of scales. A probabilistic formulation is used to combine the results obtained from filtering in each domain to provide a final edge probability image which has the advantages of both spatial and scale-space domain methods. Decomposing this edge probability image with the same wavelet as the original image permits the generation of adaptive filters that can recognize the characteristics of the edges in all wavelet detail and approximation images regardless of scale. These matched filters permit significant reduction in image noise without contributing to edge distortion. The spatially adaptive wavelet noise-filtering algorithm is qualitatively and quantitatively compared to a frequency domain and two wavelet based noise suppression algorithms using both natural and computer generated noisy images,"['spatial techniques', 'scale-space techniques', 'edge detection', 'spatially adaptive wavelet-based noise filtering algorithm', 'a priori knowledge', 'geometrical characteristics', 'probability factor', 'double thresholding technique', 'spatial domain filtering', 'pixel similarity', 'gradient amplitudes', 'gradient phases', 'edge connectivity', 'dynamic range compression', 'wavelet correlation', 'probabilistic formulation', 'final edge probability image', 'adaptive filters', 'approximation images', 'matched filters', 'image noise', 'spatially adaptive wavelet noise-filtering algorithm', 'noise suppression', 'adaptive filters', 'data compression', 'edge detection', 'image enhancement', 'matched filters', 'noise', 'probability', 'wavelet transforms']",221,31
1791,1980,Lossy to lossless object-based coding of 3-D MRI data We propose a fully three-dimensional 3-D object-based coding system exploiting the diagnostic relevance of the different regions of the volumetric data for rate allocation. The data are first decorrelated via a 3-D discrete wavelet transform. The implementation via the lifting steps scheme allows to map integer-to-integer values enabling lossless coding and facilitates the definition of the object-based inverse transform. The coding process assigns disjoint segments of the bitstream to the different objects which can be independently accessed and reconstructed at any up-to-lossless quality. Two fully 3-D coding strategies are considered embedded zerotree coding EZW-3D and multidimensional layered zero coding MLZC both generalized for region of interest ROI)-based processing. In order to avoid artifacts along region boundaries some extra coefficients must be encoded for each object. This gives rise to an overheading of the bitstream with respect to the case where the volume is encoded as a whole. The amount of such extra information depends on both the filter length and the decomposition depth. The system is characterized on a set of head magnetic resonance images. Results show that MLZC and EZW-3D have competitive performances.

1801,1990,Electrical facility construction work for information network structuring by the use of sewage conduits To confront the advent of the advanced information society there has been a pressing demand for the adjustment of the communications infrastructure and the structuring of the information network by utilizing the sewage conduits. The City of Tokyo is promoting a project by the name of the sewer optical fiber teleway SOFT network plan. According to this plan the total distance of the optical fiber network laid in the sewer conduits is scheduled to reach about 470 km by the end of March 2000. At the final stage this distance will reach 800 km as a whole.

1802,1991,A framework for evaluating the data-hiding capacity of image sources An information-theoretic model for image watermarking and data hiding is presented in this paper. Previous theoretical results are used to characterize the fundamental capacity limits of image watermarking and data-hiding systems. Capacity is determined by the statistical model used for the host image by the distortion constraints on the data hider and the attacker and by the information available to the data hider to the attacker and to the decoder. We consider autoregressive block-DCT and wavelet statistical models for images and compute data-hiding capacity for compressed and uncompressed host-image sources. Closed-form expressions are obtained under sparse-model approximations. Models for geometric attacks and distortion measures that are invariant to such attacks are considered,"['data-hiding capacity', 'image sources', 'information-theoretic model', 'watermarking', 'capacity limits', 'statistical model', 'distortion constraints', 'autoregressive statistical models', 'block-DCT statistical models', 'wavelet statistical models', 'compressed host-image sources', 'uncompressed host-image sources', 'closed-form expressions', 'sparse-model approximations', 'geometric attacks', 'distortion measures', 'autoregressive processes', 'copy protection', 'data compression', 'data encapsulation', 'discrete cosine transforms', 'image coding', 'statistical analysis', 'wavelet transforms']",122,24
1803,1992,Geometrically invariant watermarking using feature points This paper presents a new approach for watermarking of digital images providing robustness to geometrical distortions. The weaknesses of classical watermarking methods to geometrical distortions are outlined first. Geometrical distortions can be decomposed into two classes global transformations such as rotations and translations and local transformations such as the StirMark attack. An overview of existing self-synchronizing schemes is then presented. Theses schemes can use periodical properties of the mark invariant properties of transforms template insertion or information provided by the original image to counter geometrical distortions. Thereafter a new class of watermarking schemes using the image content is presented. We propose an embedding and detection scheme where the mark is bound with a content descriptor defined by salient points. Three different types of feature points are studied and their robustness to geometrical transformations is evaluated to develop an enhanced detector. The embedding of the signature is done by extracting feature points of the image and performing a Delaunay tessellation on the set of points. The mark is embedded using a classical additive scheme inside each triangle of the tessellation. The detection is done using correlation properties on the different triangles. The performance of the presented scheme is evaluated after JPEG compression geometrical attack and transformations. Results show that the fact that the scheme is robust to these different manipulations.

1804,1993,Color plane interpolation using alternating projections Most commercial digital cameras use color filter arrays to sample red green and blue colors according to a specific pattern. At the location of each pixel only one color sample is taken and the values of the other colors must be interpolated using neighboring samples. This color plane interpolation is known as demosaicing it is one of the important tasks in a digital camera pipeline. If demosaicing is not performed appropriately images suffer from highly visible color artifacts. In this paper we present a new demosaicing technique that uses inter-channel correlation effectively in an alternating-projections scheme. We have compared this technique with six state-of-the-art demosaicing techniques and it outperforms all of them both visually and in terms of mean square error,"['color plane interpolation', 'alternating projections', 'digital cameras', 'demosaicing', 'color filter arrays', 'color artifacts', 'inter-channel correlation', 'cameras', 'correlation methods', 'image colour analysis', 'interpolation', 'optical filters']",127,12

We test a number of the leading computational color constancy algorithms using a comprehensive set of images. These were of 33 different scenes under 11 different sources representative of common illumination conditions. The algorithms studied include two gray world methods a version of the Retinex method several variants of Forsyth's 1990 gamut-mapping method Cardei et al.'s 2000 neural net method and Finlayson et al.'s color by correlation method Finlayson et al. 1997 2001 Hubel and Finlayson 2000).

All data used for this study are available online at http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~color/data and implementations for most of the algorithms are also available http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~color/code). Experiments with synthesized data part one of this paper suggested that the methods which emphasize the use of the input data statistics specifically color by correlation and the neural net algorithm are potentially the most effective at estimating the chromaticity of the scene illuminant. Unfortunately we were unable to realize comparable performance on real images.

1806,1995,A comparison of computational color constancy algorithms. I Methodology and experiments with synthesized data We introduce a context for testing computational color constancy specify our approach to the implementation of a number of the leading algorithms and report the results of three experiments using synthesized data. Experiments using synthesized data are important because the ground truth is known possible confounds due to camera characterization and pre-processing are absent and various factors affecting color constancy can be efficiently investigated because they can be manipulated individually and precisely. The algorithms chosen for close study include two gray world methods a limiting case of a version of the Retinex method a number of variants of Forsyth's 1990 gamut-mapping method Cardei et al.'s 2000 neural net method and Finlayson et al.'s color by correlation method Finlayson et al. 1997 2001 Hubel and Finlayson 2000 . We investigate the ability of these algorithms to make estimates of three different color constancy quantities the chromaticity of the scene illuminant the overall magnitude of that illuminant and a corrected illumination invariant image. We consider algorithm performance as a function of the number of surfaces in scenes generated from reflectance spectra the relative effect on the algorithms of added specularities and the effect of subsequent clipping of the data.

1807,1996,Quality image metrics for synthetic images based on perceptual color differences Due to the improvement of image rendering processes and the increasing importance of quantitative comparisons among synthetic color images it is essential to define perceptually based metrics which enable to objectively assess the visual quality of digital simulations. In response to this need this paper proposes a new methodology for the determination of an objective image quality metric and gives an answer to this problem through three metrics. This methodology is based on the LLAB color space for perception of color in complex images a modification of the CIELab1976 color space. The first metric proposed is a pixel by pixel metric which introduces a local distance map between two images. The second metric associates to a pair of images a global value. Finally the third metric uses a recursive subdivision of the images to obtain an adaptative distance map rougher but less expensive to compute than the first method,"['quality image metrics', 'synthetic images', 'perceptual color differences', 'image rendering', 'color images', 'perceptually based metrics', 'visual quality', 'digital simulations', 'LLAB color space', 'CIELab1976 color space', 'pixel by pixel metric', 'local distance map', 'global value', 'recursive subdivision', 'adaptative distance map', 'image colour analysis', 'rendering (computer graphics)']",160,17

1812,2001,A simple graphic approach for observer decomposition Based upon the proposition that the roles of inputs and outputs in a physical system and those in the corresponding output-injection observer do not really have to be consistent a systematic procedure is developed in this work to properly divide a set of sparse system models and measurement models into a number of independent subsets with the help of a visual aid. Several smaller sub-observers can then be constructed accordingly to replace the original one. The size of each sub-observer may be further reduced by strategically selecting one or more appended states. These techniques are shown to be quite effective in relieving on-line computation load of the output-injection observers and also in identifying detectable sub-systems,"['graphic approach', 'observer decomposition', 'output-injection observer', 'sparse system models', 'measurement models', 'independent subsets', 'sub-observers', 'online computation load', 'detectable subsystems', 'computational complexity', 'observers']",122,11
1813,2002,A new subspace identification approach based on principal component analysis Principal component analysis PCA has been widely used for monitoring complex industrial processes with multiple variables and diagnosing process and sensor faults. The objective of this paper is to develop a new subspace identification algorithm that gives consistent model estimates under the errors-in-variables EIV situation. In this paper we propose a new subspace identification approach using principal component analysis. PCA naturally falls into the category of EIV formulation which resembles total least squares and allows for errors in both process input and output. We propose to use PCA to determine the system observability subspace the matrices and the system order for an EIV formulation. Standard PCA is modified with instrumental variables in order to achieve consistent estimates of the system matrices.

1816,2005,State-of-the-art in orthopaedic surgical navigation with a focus on medical image modalities This paper presents a review of surgical navigation systems in orthopaedics and categorizes these systems according to the image modalities that are used for the visualization of surgical action. Medical images used to be an essential part of surgical education and documentation as well as diagnosis and operation planning over many years. With the recent introduction of navigation techniques in orthopaedic surgery a new field of application has been opened. Today surgical navigation systems  also known as image-guided surgery systems  are available for various applications in orthopaedic surgery. They visualize the position and orientation of surgical instruments as graphical overlays onto a medical image of the operated anatomy on a computer monitor. Preoperative image data such as computed tomography scans or intra operatively generated images for example ultrasonic endoscopic or fluoroscopic images are suitable for this purpose. A new category of medical images termed surgeon-defined anatomy has been developed that exclusively relies upon the usage of navigation technology. Points on the anatomy are digitized interactively by the surgeon and are used to build up an abstract geometrical model of the bony structures to be operated on.

A two-dimensional followed by a three-dimensional analysis is performed. The algorithm first detects the thorax contour the lungs and the ribs which further help the detection of metastases. Thus two types of tumors are detected nodules and metastases located at the lung extremities. A method to visualize the anatomical structures segmented is also presented.

1820,2009,A survey of interactive mesh-cutting techniques and a new method for implementing generalized interactive mesh cutting using virtual tools In our experience mesh-cutting methods can be distinguished by how their solutions address the following major issues definition of the cut path primitive removal and re-meshing number of new primitives created when re-meshing is performed and representation of the cutting tool. Many researchers have developed schemes for interactive mesh cutting with the goals of reducing the number of new primitives created creating new primitives with good aspect ratios avoiding a disconnected mesh structure between primitives in the cut path and representing the path traversed by the tool as accurately as possible. The goal of this paper is to explain how by using a very simple framework one can build a generalized cutting scheme. This method allows for any arbitrary cut to be made within a virtual object and can simulate cutting surface layered surface or tetrahedral objects using a virtual scalpel scissors or loop cautery tool.

1821,2010,Scale-invariant segmentation of dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MR images with inherent scale selection Selection of the best set of scales is problematic when developing signal-driven approaches for pixel-based image segmentation. Often different possibly conflicting criteria need to be fulfilled in order to obtain the best trade-off between uncertainty variance and location accuracy. The optimal set of scales depends on several factors the noise level present in the image material the prior distribution of the different types of segments the class-conditional distributions associated with each type of segment as well as the actual size of the connected segments. We analyse theoretically and through experiments the possibility of using the overall and class-conditional error rates as criteria for selecting the optimal sampling of the linear and morphological scale spaces. It is shown that the overall error rate is optimized by taking the prior class distribution in the image material into account. However a uniform ignorant prior distribution ensures constant class-conditional error rates. Consequently we advocate for a uniform prior class distribution when an uncommitted scale-invariant segmentation approach is desired. Experiments with a neural net classifier developed for segmentation of dynamic magnetic resonance MR images acquired with a paramagnetic tracer support the theoretical results. Furthermore the experiments show that the addition of spatial features to the classifier extracted from the linear or morphological scale spaces improves the segmentation result compared to a signal-driven approach based solely on the dynamic MR signal. The segmentation results obtained from the two types of features are compared using two novel quality measures that characterize spatial properties of labelled images,"['scale-invariant segmentation', 'dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion MR images', 'inherent scale selection', 'pixel-based image segmentation', 'noise level', 'class-conditional error rates', 'optimal sampling', 'experiments', 'neural net classifier', 'dynamic magnetic resonance images', 'paramagnetic tracer', 'quality measures', 'labelled images', 'class-conditional distributions', 'biomedical MRI', 'image classification', 'image sampling', 'image segmentation', 'medical image processing', 'neural nets']",261,20
1822,2011,Innovative phase unwrapping algorithm hybrid approach We present a novel algorithm based on a hybrid of the global and local treatment of a wrapped map. The proposed algorithm is especially effective for the unwrapping of speckle-coded interferogram contour maps. In contrast to earlier unwrapping algorithms by region we propose a local discontinuity-restoring criterion to serve as the preprocessor or postprocessor of our hybrid algorithm which makes the unwrapping by region much easier and more efficient.

1823,2012,Strain contouring using Gabor filters principle and algorithm Moire interferometry is a powerful technique for high sensitivity in-plane deformation contouring. However from an engineering viewpoint the derivatives of displacement i.e. strain are the desired parameter. Thus there is a need to differentiate the displacement field. Optical and digital methods have been proposed for this differentiation. Optical methods provide contours that still need to be quantified while digital methods suffer from drawbacks inherent in the digital differentiation process. We describe a novel approach of strain segmentation for the moire pattern using a multichannel Gabor filter. Appropriate filter design allows for user-specific segmentation which is essentially in engineering design and analysis,"['strain contouring', 'Gabor filters', 'algorithm', 'moire interferometry', 'high sensitivity in-plane deformation contouring', 'displacement', 'displacement field', 'digital methods', 'optical methods', 'differentiation', 'digital differentiation process', 'strain segmentation', 'multichannel Gabor filter', 'filter design', 'user-specific segmentation', 'engineering design', 'engineering analysis', 'image segmentation', 'spatial filters', 'deformation', 'image segmentation', 'light interferometry', 'moire fringes', 'nondestructive testing', 'spatial filters', 'strain measurement']",109,26

1825,2014,Adaptive filtering for noise reduction in hue saturation intensity color space Even though the hue saturation intensity HSI color model has been widely used in color image processing and analysis the conversion formulas from the RGB color model to HSI are nonlinear and complicated in comparison with the conversion formulas of other color models. When an RGB image is degraded by random Gaussian noise this nonlinearity leads to a nonuniform noise distribution in HSI making accurate image analysis more difficult. We have analyzed the noise characteristics of the HSI color model and developed an adaptive spatial filtering method to reduce the magnitude of noise and the nonuniformity of noise variance in the HSI color space. With this adaptive filtering method the filter kernel for each pixel is dynamically adjusted depending on the values of intensity and saturation. In our experiments we have filtered the saturation and hue components and generated edge maps from color gradients. We have found that by using the adaptive filtering method the minimum error rate in edge detection improves by approximately 15,"['adaptive filtering', 'noise reduction', 'hue saturation intensity color space', 'color image processing', 'color image analysis', 'RGB color model', 'random Gaussian noise', 'nonuniform noise distribution', 'accurate image analysis', 'adaptive spatial filtering method', 'nonuniformity', 'noise variance', 'HSI color space', 'filter kernel', 'pixel', 'saturation', 'intensity', 'generated edge maps', 'color gradients', 'edge detection', 'minimum error rate', 'adaptive optics', 'colorimetry', 'edge detection', 'image colour analysis', 'optical noise', 'optical saturation', 'spatial filters']",176,28

The 3-D information of the objects is codified in deformed fringe patterns using the Fourier transform profilometry technique and is correlated using a classical convergent correlator. The scale invariance property is achieved using two different approaches the Mellin radial harmonic decomposition and the logarithmic radial harmonic filter.

An intelligent ROI location algorithm based on the Radon transform is developed to automate the calibration process. The algorithm remains robust even if the anchor target has a notable rotation angle in the target plane. This method functions well although the anchor target is not carefully positioned. Several improvement methods are studied to avoid the algorithm's huge time/space consumption problem. The algorithm runs about 100 times faster if these improvement methods are applied. Using this method fully automatic camera calibration is achieved without human interactive ROI specification.

1828,2017,Autofocus system for microscope A technique is developed for microscope autofocusing which is called the eccentric light beam approach with high resolution wide focusing range and compact construction. The principle is described. The theoretical formula of the eccentric light beam approach deduced can be applied not only to an object lens whose objective plane is just at the focal plane but also to an object lens whose objective plane is not at the focal plane. The experimental setup uses a semiconductor laser device as the light source. The laser beam that enters into the microscope is eccentric with the main light axis. A defocused signal is acquired by a symmetrical silicon photocell for the change of the reflected light position caused by differential amplification and processed by a microprocessor. Then the electric signal is power-amplified and drives a dc motor which moves a fine working platform to an automatic focus of the microscope. The result of the experiments shows a +or-0.1 mu m precision of autofocusing for a range of +or-500 mu m defocusing.

1829,2018,Design and implementation of a 3-D mapping system for highly irregular shaped objects with application to semiconductor manufacturing The basic technology for a robotic system is developed to automate the packing of polycrystalline silicon nuggets into fragile fused silica crucible in Czochralski melt pulling semiconductor wafer production. The highly irregular shapes of the nuggets and the packing constraints make this a difficult and challenging task. It requires the delicate manipulation and packing of highly irregular polycrystalline silicon nuggets into a fragile fused silica crucible. For this application a dual optical 3-D surface mapping system that uses active laser triangulation has been developed and successfully tested. One part of the system measures the geometry profile of a nugget being packed and the other the profile of the nuggets already in the crucible. A resolution of 1 mm with 15-KHz sampling frequency is achieved. Data from the system are used by the packing algorithm which determines optimal nugget placement.

1830,2019,Effective moving cast shadow detection for monocular color traffic image sequences For an accurate scene analysis using monocular color traffic image sequences a robust segmentation of moving vehicles from the stationary background is generally required. However the presence of moving cast shadow may lead to an inaccurate vehicle segmentation and as a result may lead to further erroneous scene analysis. We propose an effective method for the detection of moving cast shadow. By observing the characteristics of cast shadow in the luminance chrominance gradient density and geometry domains a combined probability map called a shadow confidence score SCS is obtained. From the edge map of the input image each edge pixel is examined to determine whether it belongs to the vehicle region based on its neighboring SCSs. The cast shadow is identified as those regions with high SCSs which are outside the convex hull of the selected vehicle edge pixels. The proposed method is tested on 100 vehicle images taken under different lighting conditions sunny and cloudy viewing angles roadside and overhead vehicle sizes small medium and large and colors similar to the road and not).

1831,2020,Restoration of broadband imagery steered with a liquid-crystal optical phased array In many imaging applications it is highly desirable to replace mechanical beam-steering components i.e. mirrors and gimbals with a nonmechanical device. One such device is a nematic liquid crystal optical phased array LCOPA). An LCOPA can implement a blazed phase grating to steer the incident light. However when a phase grating is used in a broadband imaging system two adverse effects can occur. First dispersion will cause different incident wavelengths arriving at the same angle to be steered to different output angles causing chromatic aberrations in the image plane. Second the device will steer energy not only to the first diffraction order but to others as well. This multiple-order effect results in multiple copies of the scene appearing in the image plane. We describe a digital image restoration technique designed to overcome these degradations. The proposed postprocessing technique is based on a Wiener deconvolution filter. The technique however is applicable only to scenes containing objects with approximately constant reflectivities over the spectral region of interest.

1834,2023,Diffraction limit for a circular mask with a periodic rectangular apertures array A mask with periodic apertures imaging system is adopted very widely and plays a leading role in modern technology for uses such as pinhole cameras coded imaging systems optical information processing etc. because of its high resolution its infinite depth of focus and its usefulness over a broad frequency spectra ranging from visible light to X-rays and gamma rays. While the masks with periodic apertures investigated in the literature are limited only to far-field diffraction they do not take the shift of apertures within the mask into consideration. Therefore the derivation of the far-field diffraction for a single aperture cannot be applied to a mask with periodic apertures. The far-field diffraction formula modified for a multiaperture mask has been proposed in the past the analysis remains too complicated to offer some practical guidance for mask design. We study a circular mask with periodic rectangular apertures and develop an easier way to interpret it. First the near-field diffraction intensity of a circular aperture is calculated by means of Lommel's function. Then the convolution of the circular mask diffraction with periodic rectangular apertures is put together and we can present a simple mathematical tool to analyze the mask properties including the intensity distribution blurring aberration and the criterion of defining the far or near-field diffraction.

1835,2024,Binocular model for figure-ground segmentation in translucent and occluding images A Fourier-based solution to the problem of figure-ground segmentation in short baseline binocular image pairs is presented. Each image is modeled as an additive composite of two component images that exhibit a spatial shift due to the binocular parallax. The segmentation is accomplished by decoupling each Fourier component in one of the resultant additive images into its two constituent phasors allocating each to its appropriate object-specific spectrum and then reconstructing the foreground and background using the inverse Fourier transform. It is shown that the foreground and background shifts can be computed from the differences of the magnitudes and phases of the Fourier transform of the binocular image pair. While the model is based on translucent objects it also works with occluding objects,"['binocular model', 'figure-ground segmentation', 'translucent images', 'occluding images', 'images', 'image segmentation', 'Fourier-based solution', 'short baseline binocular image pairs', 'component images', 'spatial shift', 'binocular parallax', 'Fourier component decoupling', 'phasors', 'object-specific spectrum', 'foreground', 'background', 'inverse Fourier transform', 'binocular image pair', 'translucent objects', 'occluding objects', 'Fourier transform optics', 'image segmentation', 'inverse problems']",132,23

To convert the camera output signals to device-independent color data two main approaches are proposed and evaluated. One consists in applying regression methods to convert from the K camera outputs to a device-independent color space such as CIEXYZ or CIELAB.

A mixed-norm functional is introduced which combines the least mean square LMS and the least mean fourth LMF functionals as well as a smoothing functional. Two regularization parameters are introduced one to determine the relative importance of the LMS and LMF functionals which is a function of the kurtosis and another to determine the relative importance of the smoothing functional. The two parameters are chosen in such a way that the proposed functional is convex so that a unique minimizer exists. An iterative algorithm is utilized for obtaining the solution and its convergence is analyzed. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is that no knowledge of the noise distribution is required and the relative contributions of the LMS the LMF and the smoothing functionals are adjusted based on the partially restored image.

These methods are invariant to changes in the position orientation and scale of the object and result in good noise-smoothing performance. We use spatial light modulators SLMs to directly implement the input of the image and filter information for the purpose of these approaches.

As memory chips are much slower than arithmetic processors codes that involve a high data movement compared to the number of arithmetic operations are executed comparatively slower. Hence matrix-matrix multiplications are much faster than matrix-vector multiplications. It is seen that it is not sufficient to compare only the complexity but also the actual performance of algorithms to judge on faster execution. Implications involve FDTD loops LU factorizations and iterative solvers for dense matrices. Run times on two reference platforms namely an Athlon 900 MHz and an HP PA 8600 processor verify the findings,"['computational electromagnetics codes', 'computer architecture', 'algorithmic complexity', 'innermost loops', 'CEM codes', 'operation count', 'computer hardware', 'memory chips', 'data movement', 'matrix-matrix multiplications', 'matrix-vector multiplications', 'FDTD loops', 'LU factorizations', 'iterative solvers', 'dense matrices', 'computational complexity', 'computer architecture', 'electrical engineering computing', 'electromagnetism', 'finite difference time-domain analysis', 'iterative methods', 'matrix decomposition', 'matrix multiplication']",135,23

1856,2046,Designing and delivering a university course  a process or operations management perspective With over 30 years of academic experience in both engineering and management faculties involving trial and error experimentation in teaching as well as reading relevant literature and observing other instructors in action the author has accumulated a number of ideas regarding the preparation and delivery of a university course that should be of interest to other instructors. This should be particularly the case for those individuals who have had little or no teaching experience e.g. those whose graduate education was recently completed at research-oriented institutions providing little guidance with respect to teaching). A particular perspective is used to convey the ideas namely one of viewing the preparation and delivery of a course as two major processes that should provide outputs or outcomes that are of value to a number of customers in particular students,"['university course delivery', 'management perspective', 'academic experience', 'management faculties', 'engineering faculties', 'search-oriented institutions', 'educational courses']",146,7

Since the game continues as long as a contestant answers correctly this case at its core is one of sequential decision analysis amenable to analysis via stochastic dynamic programming. The case is also suitable for a course dealing with single decision analysis allowing for discussion of utility theory and Bayesian probability revision.

1864,2054,Teaching modeling in management science This essay discusses how we can most effectively teach Management Science to students in MBA or similar programs who will be at best part-time practitioners of these arts. I take as a working hypothesis the radical proposition that the heart of Management Science itself is not the impressive array of tools that have been built up over the years optimization simulation decision analysis queuing and so on but rather the art of reasoning logically with formal models. I believe it is necessary with this group of students to teach basic modeling skills and in fact it is only when such students have these basic skills as a foundation that they are prepared to acquire the more sophisticated skills needed to employ Management Science. In this paper I present a hierarchy of modeling skills from numeracy skills through sophisticated Management Science skills as a framework within which to plan courses for the occasional practitioner,"['management science', 'modeling', 'numeracy skills', 'formal models', 'decision analysis', 'educational courses', 'management science', 'modelling']",158,8
1865,2055,Causes of the decline of the business school management science course The business school management science course is suffering serious decline. The traditional model and algorithm-based course fails to meet the needs of MBA programs and students. Poor student mathematical preparation is a reality and is not an acceptable justification for poor teaching outcomes. Management science Ph.D.s are often poorly prepared to teach in a general management program having more experience and interest in algorithms than management. The management science profession as a whole has focused its attention on algorithms and a narrow subset of management problems for which they are most applicable. In contrast MBA's rarely encounter problems that are suitable for straightforward application of management science tools living instead in a world where problems are ill-defined data is scarce time is short politics is dominant and rational decision makers are non-existent. The root cause of the profession's failure to address these issues seems to be in Russell Ackoff's words a habit of professional introversion that caused the profession to be uninterested in what MBA's really do on the job and how management science can help them,"['business school management science course', 'MBA programs', 'MBA students', 'management science', 'profession', 'educational courses', 'management science', 'professional aspects']",188,8
1866,2056,Gifts to a science academic librarian Gifts by their altruistic nature perfectly fit into the environment of universities and academic libraries. As a university's community and general public continue to donate materials libraries accept donations willingly both in-kind and monetary. Eight steps of gift processing are listed in the paper. Positive and negative aspects of gift acceptance are discussed. Gifts bring value for academic libraries. Gifts can be considered additional routes to contribute to library collections without direct purchases options to add money to the library budget and the cement of social relationships. But unfortunately large donations are time-consuming labor-intensive and costly to process. Great amounts of staff time and processing space are two main negative aspects that cause concern and put the value of gift acceptance under consideration by librarians. Some strategies in handling gifts are recommended. To be effective academic science librarians need to approach gifts as an investment. Librarians are not to be forced by moral and public notions and should be able to make professional decisions in evaluating proposed collections,"['science academic librarian', 'academic libraries', 'donations', 'gift processing', 'library collections', 'budget', 'staff time', 'professional decisions', 'research libraries', 'acquisitions', 'gift books', 'academic libraries', 'library automation', 'research libraries']",174,14

1875,2065,Emotion and self-control A biology-based model of choice is used to examine time-inconsistent preferences and the problem of self-control. Emotion is shown to be the biological substrate of choice in that emotional systems assign value to goods in the environment and also facilitate the learning of expectations regarding alternative options for acquiring those goods. A third major function of the emotional choice systems is motivation. Self-control is shown to be the result of a problem with the inhibition of the motive force of emotion where this inhibition is necessary for higher level deliberation,"['choice model', 'inhibition', 'learning', 'time-inconsistent preferences', 'self-control', 'emotional choice systems', 'emotion', 'psychology']",93,8

This study elicits private and social intertemporal preferences for non-fatal changes in health. Specific functional forms of the DU model and three hyperbolic models are fitted. The results show that the stationarity axiom is violated and that the hyperbolic models fit the data better than the DU model.

1878,2068,Modeling the labor market as an evolving institution model ARTEMIS A stylized French labor market is modeled as an endogenously evolving institution. Boundedly rational firms and individuals strive to decrease the cost or increase utility. The labor market is coordinated by a search process and decentralized setting of hiring standards but intermediaries can speed up matching. The model reproduces the dynamics of the gross flows and spectacular changes in mobility patterns of some demographic groups when the oil crisis in the 1970's occurred notably the sudden decline of the integration in good jobs. The internal labor markets of large firms are shown to increase unemployment if the secondary temporary or bad jobs do not exist,"['ARTEMIS model', 'French labor market', 'endogenously evolving institution', 'simulation model', 'jobs', 'endogenous intermediary', 'spectacular changes', 'mobility patterns', 'demographic groups', 'demography', 'employment', 'simulation', 'social sciences']",115,13
1879,2069,The ultimate control group Empirical research on the organization of firms requires that firms be classified on the basis of their control structures. This should be done in a way that can potentially be made operational. It is easy to identify the ultimate controller of a hierarchical organization and the literature has largely focused on this case. However many organizational structures mix hierarchy with collective choice procedures such as voting or use circular structures under which superiors are accountable to their subordinates. The author develops some analytic machinery that can be used to map the authority structures of such organizations and show that under mild restrictions there is a well-defined ultimate control group. The results are consistent with intuitions about the nature of control in familiar economic settings,"['ultimate control group', 'hierarchical organization', 'organizational structures', 'authority structures', 'committees', 'control rights', 'firm organization', 'management', 'management science', 'set theory']",128,10

1881,2081,Three-dimensional optimum design of the cooling lines of injection moulds based on boundary element design sensitivity analysis A three-dimensional numerical simulation using the boundary element method is proposed which can predict the cavity temperature distributions in the cooling stage of injection moulding. Then choosing the radii and positions of cooling lines as design variables the boundary integral sensitivity formulations are deduced. For the optimum design of cooling lines the squared difference between the objective temperature and temperature of the cavity is taken as the objective function. Based on the optimization techniques with design sensitivity analysis an iterative algorithm to reach the minimum value of the objective function is introduced which leads to the optimum design of cooling lines at the same time,"['injection moulding', '3D numerical simulation', 'boundary element method', 'cavity temperature distributions', 'cooling stage', 'boundary integral sensitivity analysis', 'iterative algorithm', 'heat conduction', 'objective function', 'optimization', 'boundary-elements methods', 'cooling', 'iterative methods', 'moulding', 'optimisation', 'plastics industry', 'process control', 'sensitivity analysis', 'solid modelling']",122,19
1882,2082,Managing safety and strategic stocks to improve materials requirements planning performance This paper provides a methodology for managing safety and strategic stocks in materials requirements planning MRP environments to face uncertainty in market demand. A set of recommended guidelines suggest where to position how to dimension and when to replenish both safety and strategic stocks. Trade-offs between stock positioning and dimensioning and between stock positioning and replenishment order triggering are outlined. The study reveals also that most of the decisions are system specific so that they should be evaluated in a quantitative manner through simulation. A case study is reported where the benefits from adopting the new proposed methodology lie in achieving the target service level even under peak demand conditions with the value of safety stocks as a whole growing only by about 20 per cent,"['MRP', 'materials requirements planning', 'market demand', 'strategic stocks', 'safety stocks', 'inventory management', 'variance control', 'stock replenishment', 'service level', 'peak demand', 'management', 'manufacturing resources planning', 'production control', 'stock control']",137,14

1891,2091,Prospects for quantitative computed tomography imaging in the presence of foreign metal bodies using statistical image reconstruction X-ray computed tomography CT images of patients bearing metal intracavitary applicators or other metal foreign objects exhibit severe artifacts including streaks and aliasing. We have systematically evaluated via computer simulations the impact of scattered radiation the polyenergetic spectrum and measurement noise on the performance of three reconstruction algorithms conventional filtered backprojection FBP deterministic iterative deblurring and a new iterative algorithm alternating minimization AM based on a CT detector model that includes noise scatter and polyenergetic spectra. Contrary to the dominant view of the literature FBP streaking artifacts are due mostly to mismatches between FBP's simplified model of CT detector response and the physical process of signal acquisition. Artifacts on AM images are significantly mitigated as this algorithm substantially reduces detector-model mismatches. However metal artifacts are reduced to acceptable levels only when prior knowledge of the metal object in the patient including its pose shape and attenuation map are used to constrain AM's iterations. AM image reconstruction in combination with object-constrained CT to estimate the pose of metal objects in the patient is a promising approach for effectively mitigating metal artifacts and making quantitative estimation of tissue attenuation coefficients a clinical possibility,"['quantitative computed tomography imaging', 'foreign metal bodies', 'statistical image reconstruction', 'metal artifact reduction', 'brachytherapy', 'medical diagnostic imaging', 'signal acquisition physical process', 'object-constrained CT', 'iterative algorithm', 'alternating minimization', 'CT detector model', 'noise', 'scatter', 'polyenergetic spectra', 'clinical possibility', 'deterministic iterative deblurring', 'filtered backprojection', 'computerised tomography', 'digital simulation', 'image reconstruction', 'iterative methods', 'medical image processing', 'X-ray absorption', 'X-ray scattering']",208,24
1892,2092,Matching PET and CT scans of the head and neck area Development of method and validation Positron emission tomography PET provides important information on tumor biology but lacks detailed anatomical information. Our aim in the present study was to develop and validate an automatic registration method for matching PET and CT scans of the head and neck. Three difficulties in achieving this goal are 1 nonrigid motions of the neck can hamper the use of automatic ridged body transformations 2 emission scans contain too little anatomical information to apply standard image fusion methods and 3 no objective way exists to quantify the quality of the match results. These problems are solved as follows accurate and reproducible positioning of the patient was achieved by using a radiotherapy treatment mask. The proposed method makes use of the transmission rather than the emission scan. To obtain sufficient anatomical information for matching two bed positions for the transmission scan were included in the protocol. A mutual information-based algorithm was used as a registration technique. PET and CT data were obtained in seven patients. Each patient had two CT scans and one PET scan. The datasets were used to estimate the consistency by matching PET to CT/sub 1 CT/sub 1 to CT/sub 2 and CT/sub 2 to PET using the full circle consistency test. It was found that using our method consistency could be obtained of 4 mm and 1.3 degrees on average. The PET voxels used for registration were 5.15 mm so the errors compared quite favorably with the voxel size. Cropping the images removing the scanner bed from images did not improve the consistency of the algorithm. The transmission scan however could potentially be reduced to a single position using this approach. In conclusion the represented algorithm and validation technique has several features that are attractive from both theoretical and practical point of view it is a user-independent automatic validation technique for matching CT and PET scans of the head and neck which gives the opportunity to compare different image enhancements,"['positron emission tomography scans', 'tumor biology', 'anatomical information', 'automatic registration method', 'computerised tomography scans', 'head', 'neck', 'nonrigid motions', 'automatic ridged body transformations', 'standard image fusion methods', 'radiotherapy treatment mask', 'bed positions', 'transmission scan', 'mutual information-based algorithm', 'registration technique', 'patients', 'full circle consistency test', 'errors', 'scanner bed', 'user-independent automatic validation technique', 'image enhancements', 'computerised tomography', 'diagnostic radiography', 'dosimetry', 'image registration', 'medical image processing', 'positron emission tomography', 'radiation therapy']",338,28

1894,2094,Statistical inference with partial prior information based on a Gauss-type inequality Potter and Anderson 1983 have developed a Bayesian decision procedure requiring the specification of a class of prior distributions restricted to have a minimal probability content for a given subset of the parameter space.

1895,2095,Global stability of the attracting set of an enzyme-catalysed reaction system The essential feature of enzymatic reactions is a nonlinear dependency of reaction rate on metabolite concentration taking the form of saturation kinetics. Recently it has been shown that this feature is associated with the phenomenon of loss of system coordination Liu 1999). In this paper we study a system of ordinary differential equations representing a branched biochemical system of enzyme-mediated reactions. We show that this system can become very sensitive to changes in certain maximum enzyme activities. In particular we show that the system exhibits three distinct responses a unique globally-stable steady-state large amplitude oscillations and asymptotically unbounded solutions with the transition between these states being almost instantaneous. It is shown that the appearance of large amplitude stable limit cycles occurs due to a false bifurcation or canard explosion. The subsequent disappearance of limit cycles corresponds to the collapse of the domain of attraction of the attracting set for the system and occurs due to a global bifurcation in the flow namely a saddle connection. Subsequently almost all nonnegative data become unbounded under the action of the dynamical system and correspond exactly to loss of system coordination. We discuss the relevance of these results to the possible consequences of modulating such systems,"['enzymatic reactions', 'nonlinear dependency', 'metabolite concentration', 'saturation kinetics', 'biochemical system', 'ordinary differential equations', 'enzyme-mediated reactions', 'saddle connection', 'stable limit cycles', 'bifurcation', 'bifurcation', 'biochemistry', 'catalysis', 'differential equations', 'proteins', 'reaction kinetics theory', 'stability']",213,17
1896,2096,A spatial rainfall simulator for crop production modeling in Southern Africa This paper describes a methodology for simulating rainfall in dekads across a set of spatial units in areas where long-term meteorological records are available for a small number of sites only. The work forms part of a larger simulation model of the food system in a district of Zimbabwe which includes a crop production component for yields of maize small grains and groundnuts. Only a limited number of meteorological stations are available within or surrounding the district that have long time series of rainfall records. Preliminary analysis of rainfall data for these stations suggested that intra-seasonal temporal correlation was negligible but that rainfall at any given station was correlated with rainfall at neighbouring stations. This spatial correlation structure can be modeled using a multivariate normal distribution consisting of 30 related variables representing dekadly rainfall in each of the 30 wards. For each ward log-transformed rainfall for each of the 36 dekads in the year was characterized by a mean and standard deviation which were interpolated from surrounding meteorological stations. A covariance matrix derived from a distance measure was then used to represent the spatial correlation between wards. Sets of random numbers were then drawn from this distribution to simulate rainfall across the wards in any given dekad. Cross-validation of estimated rainfall parameters against observed parameters for the one meteorological station within the district suggests that the interpolation process works well. The methodology developed is useful in situations where long-term climatic records are scarce and where rainfall shows pronounced spatial correlation but negligible temporal correlation,"['simulating rainfall', 'crop production modeling', 'Zimbabwe', 'covariance matrix', 'rainfall records', 'rainfall data', 'spatial correlation', 'multivariate normal distribution', 'parameter estimation', 'Southern Africa', 'agriculture', 'modelling', 'parameter estimation', 'rain', 'weather forecasting']",265,15

The approach is based on using linear inequalities and generally mixed variables in modelling this ability for a broad spectrum of industrial transportation agricultural and other types of firms and allows one to formulate problems of analyzing the potential of a firm as linear programming problems or mixed programming problems with linear constraints.

1903,2103,The social impact of Internet gambling Technology has always played a role in the development of gambling practices and continues to provide new market opportunities. One of the fastest growing areas is that of Internet gambling. The effect of such technologies should not be accepted uncritically particularly as there may be areas of potential concern based on what is known about problem gambling offline. This article has three aims. First it overviews some of the main social concerns about the rise of Internet gambling. Second it looks at the limited research that has been carried out in this area. Third it examines whether Internet gambling is doubly addictive given research that suggests that the Internet can be addictive itself. It is concluded that technological developments in Internet gambling will increase the potential for problem gambling globally but that many of the ideas and speculations outlined in this article need to be addressed further by large-scale empirical studies,"['social impact', 'Internet gambling', 'market opportunities', 'technological developments', 'addiction', 'electronic cash', 'psychology', 'electronic money', 'Internet', 'personal computing', 'psychology', 'social aspects of automation']",157,12

For many companies this is viewed as a speedy and cost-effective way of keeping in contact with staff and ensuring their continuing commitment to company goals. This article highlights the problems experienced by staff when managers use intranets and e-mails in an inappropriate fashion for these purposes. Issues of remoteness and isolation are discussed along with the reports of frustration and disidentification experienced.

1905,2105,Collective action in the age of the Internet mass communication and online mobilization This article examines how the Internet transforms collective action. Current practices on the Web bear witness to thriving collective action ranging from persuasive to confrontational individual to collective undertakings. Even more influential than direct calls for action is the indirect mobilizing influence of the Internet's powers of mass communication which is boosted by an antiauthoritarian ideology on the Web. Theoretically collective action through the otherwise socially isolating computer is possible because people rely on internalized group memberships and social identities to achieve social involvement. Empirical evidence from an online survey among environmental activists and nonactivists confirms that online action is considered an equivalent alternative to offline action by activists and nonactivists alike. However the Internet may slightly alter the motives underlying collective action and thereby alter the nature of collective action and social movements. Perhaps more fundamental is the reverse influence that successful collective action will have on the nature and function of the Internet,"['Internet', 'mass communication', 'online mobilization', 'collective action', 'World Wide Web', 'antiauthoritarian ideology', 'group memberships', 'social identities', 'online survey', 'anonymity', 'politics', 'human factors', 'information resources', 'Internet', 'politics', 'psychology', 'social aspects of automation']",168,17
1906,2106,Explanations for the perpetration of and reactions to deception in a virtual community Cases of identity deception on the Internet are not uncommon. Several cases of a revealed identity deception have been reported in the media. The authors examine a case of deception in an online community composed primarily of information technology professionals. In this case an established community member DF invented a character Nowheremom whom he fell in love with and who was eventually killed in a tragic accident. When other members of the community eventually began to question Nowheremom's actual identity DF admitted that he invented her. The discussion board was flooded with reactions to DF's revelation. The authors propose several explanations for the perpetration of identity deception including psychiatric illness identity play and expressions of true self. They also analyze the reactions of community members and propose three related explanations social identity deviance and norm violation to account for their reactions. It is argued that virtual communities reactions to such threatening events provide invaluable clues for the study of group processes on the Internet,"['virtual community', 'identity deception', 'Internet', 'online community', 'information technology professionals', 'psychiatric illness', 'group processes', 'social processes', 'Web sites', 'psychology', 'bulletin boards', 'electronic mail', 'human factors', 'information resources', 'Internet', 'psychology', 'social aspects of automation']",177,17
1907,2107,The effects of asynchronous computer-mediated group interaction on group processes This article reports a study undertaken to investigate some of the social psychological processes underlying computer-supported group discussion in natural computer-mediated contexts. Based on the concept of deindividuation it was hypothesized that personal identifiability and group identity would be important factors that affect the perceptions and behavior of members of computer-mediated groups. The degree of personal identifiability and the strength of group identity were manipulated across groups of geographically dispersed computer users who took part in e-mail discussions during a 2-week period. The results do not support the association between deindividuation and uninhibited behavior cited in much previous research. Instead the data provide some support for a social identity perspective of computer-mediated communication which explains the higher levels uninhibited in identifiable computer-mediated groups. However predictions based on social identity theory regarding group polarization and group cohesion were not supported. Possible explanations for this are discussed and further research is suggested to resolve these discrepancies,"['asynchronous computer-mediated group interaction', 'group processes', 'social issues', 'psychology', 'deindividuation', 'Internet', 'personal identifiability', 'group identity', 'geographically dispersed computer users', 'e-mail discussions', 'social identity theory', 'group polarization', 'group cohesion', 'electronic mail', 'groupware', 'human factors', 'Internet', 'psychology', 'social aspects of automation', 'user interfaces']",164,20

1911,2111,Extended depth-of-focus imaging of chlorophyll fluorescence from intact leaves Imaging dynamic changes in chlorophyll a fluorescence provides a valuable means with which to examine localised changes in photosynthetic function. Microscope-based systems provide excellent spatial resolution which allows the response of individual cells to be measured. However such systems have a restricted depth of focus and as leaves are inherently uneven only a small proportion of each image at any given focal plane is in focus. In this report we describe the development of algorithms specifically adapted for imaging chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthetic function in living plant cells which allow extended-focus images to be reconstructed from images taken in different focal planes. We describe how these procedures can be used to reconstruct images of chlorophyll fluorescence and calculated photosynthetic parameters as well as producing a map of leaf topology.

1912,2112,Allan variance and fractal Brownian motion Noise filtering is the subject of a voluminous literature in radio engineering. The methods of filtering require knowledge of the frequency response which is usually unknown. D.W. Allan see Proc. IEEE vol.54 no.2 p.221-30 1966 IEEE Trans. Instr. Measur. vol.IM-36 p.646-54 1987 proposed a simple method of determining the interval between equally accurate observations which does without this information. In this method the variances of the increments of noise and signal are equal so that in observations with a greater step the variations caused by noise are smaller than those caused by the signal. This method is the standard accepted by the USA metrology community.

1934,2134,Linear models of circuits based on the multivalued components Linearization and planarization of the circuit models is pivotal to the submicron technologies. On the other hand the characteristics of the VLSI circuits can be sometimes improved by using the multivalued components. It was shown that any l-level circuit based on the multivalued components is representable as an algebraic model based on l linear arithmetic polynomials mapped correspondingly into l decision diagrams that are linear and planar by nature. Complexity of representing a circuit as the linear decision diagram was estimated as O(G with G for the number of multivalued components in the circuit.

1939,2139,Generalized confidence sets for a statistically indeterminate random vector A problem is considered for the construction of confidence sets for a random vector the information on distribution parameters of which is incomplete. To obtain exact estimates and a detailed analysis of the problem the notion is introduced of a generalized confidence set for a statistically indeterminate random vector. Properties of generalized confidence sets are studied. It is shown that the standard method of estimation which relies on the unification of confidence sets leads in many cases to wider confidence estimates. For a normally distributed random vector with an inaccurately known mean value generalized confidence sets are built tip and the dependence of sizes of a generalized confidence set on the forms and parameters of a set of possible mean values is examined,"['generalized confidence sets', 'statistically indeterminate random vector', 'distribution parameters', 'normally distributed random vector', 'normal distribution', 'set theory', 'state estimation', 'stochastic systems', 'vectors']",132,9

1941,2141,System embedding. Control with reduced observer Two interrelated problems-design of the reduced observer of plant state separately and together with its control system-were considered from the standpoint of designing the multivariable linear systems from the desired matrix transfer functions. The matrix equations defining the entire constructive class of solutions of the posed problems were obtained using the system embedding technology. As was demonstrated control based on the reduced observer is capable to provide the desired response to the control input as well as the response to the nonzero initial conditions only for the directly measurable part of the components of the state vector.

1948,2148,Information security policy  what do international information security standards say One of the most important information security controls is the information security policy. This vital direction-giving document is however not always easy to develop and the authors thereof battle with questions such as what constitutes a policy. This results in the policy authors turning to existing sources for guidance. One of these sources is the various international information security standards. These standards are a good starting point for determining what the information security policy should consist of but should not be relied upon exclusively for guidance. Firstly they are not comprehensive in their coverage and furthermore tending to rather address the processes needed for successfully implementing the information security policy. It is far more important the information security policy must fit in with the organisation's culture and must therefore be developed with this in mind,"['information security policy', 'international information security standards', 'DP management', 'information systems', 'information technology', 'security of data', 'standards']",145,7

The idea that special manufacturing expertise might be required can hardly occur to anyone but that's exactly what is needed to ensure crystal-clear visibility not to mention a perfect fit every time one is pressed into place on a car production line. Comprising two thin glass sheets joined by a vinyl interlayer windshields are assembled-usually manually-to very precise product and environmental specifications.

1956,2157,Shaping the future. BendWizard a tool for off-line programming of robotic tending systems Setting up a robot to make metal cabinets or cases for desktop computers can be a complex operation. For instance one expert might be required to carry out a feasibility study and then another to actually program the robot. Understandably the need for so much expertise and the time that's required generally limits the usefulness of automation to high-volume production. Workshops producing parts in batches smaller than 50 or so or which rely heavily on semiskilled operators are therefore often discouraged from investing in automation and so miss out on its many advantages. What is needed is a software tool that operators without special knowledge of robotics or with no more than rudimentary CAD skills can use.

As in the classical modal case we define two different forms of the Beth property for L which are denoted by B1 and B2 in this paper we study the relation among B1 B2 and the interpolation properties C1 and C2. It turns out that C1 implies B1 but contrary to the boolean case is not equivalent to B1. It is shown that B2 and C2 are independent and moreover it comes out that in contrast to classical case there exists an extension of the intuitionistic modal logic of S/sub 4/-type that has not the property B2.

1962,2163,IT as a key enabler to law firm competitiveness Professional services firms have traditionally been able to thrive in virtually any market conditions. They have been consistently successful for several decades without ever needing to reexamine or change their basic operating model. However gradual but inexorable change in client expectations and the business environment over recent years now means that more of the same is no longer enough. In future law firms will increasingly need to exploit IT more effectively in order to remain competitive. To do this they will need to ensure that all their information systems function as an integrated whole and are available to their staff clients and business partners.

1975,2176,Why your Web strategy is err wrong An awkward look at a few standard views from the author who thinks that most people have got it err wrong. Like every other investment when the time comes to sign the contract the question that should be asked is not whether it is a good investment but whether it is the best investment the firm can make with the money. the author argues that he would be surprised if any law firm Web site he has seen yet would jump that particular hurdle,"['Web strategy', 'law firm Web site', 'DP management', 'information resources', 'Internet', 'legislation']",91,6
1976,2177,A humanist's legacy in medical informatics visions and accomplishments of Professor Jean-Raoul Scherrer The objective is to report on the work of Prof. Jean-Raoul Scherrer and show how his humanist vision medical skills and scientific background have enabled and shaped the development of medical informatics over the last 30 years. Starting with the mainframe-based patient-centred hospital information system DIOGENE in the 70s Prof. Scherrer developed implemented and evolved innovative concepts of man-machine interfaces distributed and federated environments leading the way with information systems that obstinately focused on the support of care providers and patients. Through a rigorous design of terminologies and ontologies the DIOGENE data would then serve as a basis for the development of clinical research data mining and lead to innovative natural language processing techniques. In parallel Prof. Scherrer supported the development of medical image management ranging from a distributed picture archiving and communication systems PACS to molecular imaging of protein electrophoreses. Recognizing the need for improving the quality and trustworthiness of medical information of the Web Prof. Scherrer created the Health-On-the Net HON foundation. These achievements made possible thanks to his visionary mind deep humanism creativity generosity and determination have made of Prof. Scherrer a true pioneer and leader of the human-centered patient-oriented application of information technology for improving healthcare,"['Professor Jean-Raoul Scherrer', 'Medical Informatics', 'mainframe based patient centered hospital information system', 'medical image management', 'PACS', 'Internet', 'DIOGENE system', 'man-machine interfaces', 'distributed systems', 'federated systems', 'data mining', 'natural language processing', 'biographies', 'health care', 'history', 'medical image processing', 'medical information systems', 'user interfaces']",213,18

1978,2179,Guidelines the Internet and personal health insights from the Canadian HEALNet experience The objectives are to summarize the insights gained in collaborative research in a Canadian Network of Centres of Excellence devoted to the promotion of evidence-based practice and to relate this experience to Internet support of health promotion and consumer health informatics. A subjective review of insights is undertaken. Work directed the development of systems incorporating guidelines care maps etc. for use by professionals met with limited acceptance. Evidence-based tools for health care consumers are a desirable complement but require radically different content and delivery modes. In addition to evidence-based material offered by professionals a wide array of Internet-based products and services provided by consumers for consumers emerged and proved a beneficial complement. The consumer-driven products and services provided via the Internet are a potentially important and beneficial complement of traditional health services. They affect the health consumer-provider roles and require changes in healthcare practices,"['collaborative research', 'Canadian Network of Centres of Excellence', 'evidence-based practice', 'Internet support', 'health promotion', 'consumer health informatics', 'personal health', 'health consumer-provider roles', 'health care', 'Internet', 'medical computing', 'medical information systems', 'medicine']",156,13

1980,2181,Development of a health guidance support system for lifestyle improvement The objective is to provide automated advice for lifestyle adjustment based on an assessment of the results of a questionnaire and medical examination or health checkup data. A system was developed that gathers data based on questions regarding weight gain exercise smoking sleep eating habits salt intake animal fat intake snacks alcohol and oral hygiene body mass index resting blood pressure fasting blood sugar total cholesterol triglycerides uric acid and liver function tests. Based on the relationships between the lifestyle data and the health checkup data a health assessment sheet was generated for persons being allocated to a multiple-risk factor syndrome group. Health assessment and useful advice for lifestyle improvement were automatically extracted with the system toward the high risk group for life style related diseases. The system is operational.

1981,2182,Organization design The continuing influence of information technology Drawing from an information processing perspective this paper examines how information technology IT has been a catalyst in the development of new forms of organizational structures. The article draws a historical linkage between the relative stability of an organization's task environment starting after the Second World War to the present environmental instability that now characterizes many industries. Specifically the authors suggest that advances in IT have enabled managers to adapt existing forms and create new models for organizational design that better fit requirements of an unstable environment. Time has seemingly borne out this hypothesis as the bureaucratic structure evolved to the matrix to the network and now to the emerging shadow structure. IT has gone from a support mechanism to a substitute for organizational structures in the form of the shadow structure. The article suggests that the evolving and expanding role of IT will continue for organizations that face unstable environments,"['organization design', 'information processing perspective', 'organizational structures', 'organization task environment', 'environmental instability', 'information technology', 'DP management', 'information technology', 'social aspects of automation']",159,9
1982,2183,Knowledge-based structures and organisational commitment Organisational commitment the emotional attachment of an employee to the employing organisation has attracted a substantial body of literature relating the concept to various antecedents including organisational structure and to a range of consequences including financially important performance factors such as productivity and staff turnover. The new areas of knowledge management and learning organisations offer substantial promise as imperatives for the organisation of business enterprises. As organisations in the contemporary environment adopt knowledge-based structures to improve their competitive position there is value in examining these structures against other performance related factors. Theoretical knowledge-based structures put forward by R. Miles et al. 1997 and J. Quinn et al. 1996 and an existing implementation are examined to determine common features inherent in these approaches. These features are posited as a typical form and their impact on organisational commitment and hence on individual and organisational performance is examined,"['knowledge-based structures', 'emotional attachment', 'performance factors', 'productivity', 'staff turnover', 'earning organisations', 'organisational commitment', 'DP management', 'knowledge based systems', 'personnel', 'social aspects of automation']",150,11
1983,2184,The evolution of information systems Their impact on organizations and structures Information systems and organization structures have been highly interconnected with each other. Over the years information systems architectures as well as organization structures have evolved from centralized to more decentralized forms. This research looks at the evolution of both information systems and organization structures. In the process it looks into the impact of computers on organizations and examines the ways organization structures have changed in association with changes in information system architectures. It also suggests logical linkages between information system architectures and their fit with certain organization structures and strategies. It concludes with some implications for emerging and future organizational forms and provides a quick review of the effect of the Internet on small businesses traditionally using stand-alone computers,"['information systems evolution', 'information system architectures', 'DP management', 'information systems', 'social aspects of automation']",130,5
1984,2185,In search of a general enterprise model Many organisations particularly SMEs are reluctant to invest time and money in models to support decision making. Such reluctance could be overcome if a model could be used for several purposes rather than using a traditional single perspective model. This requires the development of a general enterprise model GEM which can be applied to a wide range of problem domains with unlimited scope. Current enterprise modelling frameworks only deal effectively with nondynamic modelling issues whilst dynamic modelling issues have traditionally only been addressed at the operational level. Although the majority of research in this area relates to manufacturing companies the framework for a GEM must be equally applicable to service and public sector organisations. The paper identifies five key design issues that need to be considered when constructing a GEM. A framework for such a GEM is presented based on a plug and play methodology and demonstrated by a simple case study,"['general enterprise model', 'business process re-engineering', 'SMEs', 'decision making', 'single perspective model', 'GEM', 'problem domains', 'enterprise modelling frameworks', 'operational level', 'dynamic modelling issues', 'public sector organisations', 'service sector organisations', 'plug and play methodology', 'case study', 'commerce', 'decision support systems', 'systems re-engineering']",159,17
1985,2186,Strategies for high throughput templated zeolite synthesis The design and redesign of high throughput experiments for zeolite synthesis are addressed. A model that relates materials function to the chemical composition of the zeolite and the structure directing agent is introduced.

1987,2188,A nonlinear modulation strategy for hybrid AC/DC power systems A nonlinear control strategy to improve transient stability of a multi-machine AC power system with several DC links terminated in the presence of large disturbances is presented. The approach proposed in this paper is based on differential geometric theory and the HVDC systems are taken as a variable admittance connected at the inverter or rectifier AC bus. After deriving the analytical description of the relationship between the variable admittance and active power flows of each generator the traditional generator dynamic equations can thus be expressed with the variable admittance of HVDC systems as an additional state variable and changed to an affine form which is suitable for global linearization method being used to determine its control variable. An important feature of the proposed method is that the modulated DC power is an adaptive and non-linear function of AC system states and it can be realized by local feedback and less transmitted data from adjacent generators. The design procedure is tested on a dual-infeed hybrid AC/DC system,"['nonlinear control strategy', 'transient stability', 'multi-machine AC power system', 'DC links', 'nonlinear modulation strategy', 'hybrid AC/DC power systems', 'differential geometric theory', 'HVDC systems', 'variable admittance', 'inverter', 'rectifier AC bus', 'active power flows', 'generator dynamic equations', 'affine form', 'global linearization method', 'local feedback', 'adjacent generators', 'dual-infeed hybrid AC/DC system', 'electric admittance', 'feedback', 'HVDC power transmission', 'invertors', 'linearisation techniques', 'load flow', 'nonlinear control systems', 'power system control', 'rectifying circuits']",175,27

1994,2195,Modeling privacy control in context-aware systems Significant complexity issues challenge designers of context-aware systems with privacy control. Information spaces provide a way to organize information resources and services around important privacy-relevant contextual factors. In this article we describe a theoretical model for privacy control in context-aware systems based on a core abstraction of information spaces. We have previously focused on deriving socially based privacy objectives in pervasive computing environments. Building on Ravi Sandhu's four-layer OM-AM objectives models architectures and mechanisms idea we aim to use information spaces to construct a model for privacy control that supports our socially based privacy objectives. We also discuss how we can introduce decentralization a desirable property for many pervasive computing systems into our information space model using unified privacy tagging,"['privacy', 'pervasive computing', 'context-aware systems', 'privacy control', 'smart office', 'business data processing', 'data privacy', 'mobile computing']",126,8
1995,2196,ConChat a context-aware chat program ConChat is a context-aware chat program that enriches electronic communication by providing contextual information and resolving potential semantic conflicts between users.ConChat uses contextual information to improve electronic communication. Using contextual cues users can infer during a conversation what the other person is doing and what is happening in his or her immediate surroundings. For example if a user learns that the other person is talking with somebody else or is involved in some urgent activity he or she knows to expect a slower response. Conversely if the user learns that the other person is sitting in a meeting directly related to the conversation he or she then knows to respond more quickly. Also by informing users about the other person's context and tagging potentially ambiguous chat messages ConChat explores how context can improve electronic communication by reducing semantic conflicts,"['context-aware chat program', 'ConChat', 'contextual information', 'semantic conflicts', 'contextual cues', 'groupware', 'teleconferencing']",144,7
